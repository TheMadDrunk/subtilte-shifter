01
00:00:00,793 --> 00:00:00,463
On March 3, 1969, the US Navy
established a school for its best pilots, which accounted for 1% of the total.

02
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:00,433
Its purpose is to teach the art of dogfighting, air combat, and...

03
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:00,438
...to make men and women the best
fighter pilots.

04
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:00,376
They have succeeded. Today the Navy
calls it Fighter Weapons School.

05
00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:00,510
Aviators say:

06
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:04,178
TOP GUN

07
00:02:11,08 --> 00:02:13,910
Ojave Desert, California

08
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,339
Forbidden Zone
Authorization to Use Deadly Force

09
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:06,356
Hey.

10
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:12,128
what happened?

11
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,331
Ne var?

12
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:18,968
We got a withdrawal order.
They are closing the program.

13
00:04:20,70 --> 00:04:22,71
They say we're behind

14
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,207
In the deal we made ﻿for the Mark 10 .

15
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:26,409
Two more months until Mark 10.

16
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:28,711
And these tests are for the Mark 9.

17
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:30,547
That wasn't good enough.

18
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:33,616
- Who says?
- Admiral Cane.

19
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,519
Drone fighter.

20
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,855
He wants our budget transferred to his drone
program.

21
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:42,91
He's coming here to terminate the ﻿Program himself .

22
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,208
What can we do?

23
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,713
Does he want Mark 10?

24
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:06,216
Let's give him the Mark 10.

25
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,935
Let me inform you again.
The deal is for the Mark-10.

26
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,504
Not 10.1, not 10.2.

27
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:29,906
Mark-10.

28
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,308
This keeps the program alive.

29
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:36,813
I don't like that look, man.

30
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:40,83
I only have this view.

31
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:51,361
Control, this is Dark
Star. What are the values?

32
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:53,296
He can hear the control sound just fine
. And you?

33
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,32
Pretty clear. Let's move on to the departure
procedure.

34
00:05:56,66 --> 00:05:57,800
I'm ready for ATU, sir.

35
00:05:58,202 --> 00:06:00,169
Rear left engine running.

36
00:06:01,705 --> 00:06:03,373
Rear right engine is running.

37
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:05,975
Acceleration confirmation?

38
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,445
We are ready to accelerate.

39
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:14,550
Dark Star's main
engines are ready for takeoff.

40
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,319
Dark Star's engines are active.

41
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:19,322
It's on track 2.
Its course is 2-1-0-1-0.

42
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:22,91
Engine temperature
seems fine. Check confirmed.

43
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,61
Dark Star is at 95% power
and pressure looks good.

44
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,229
Check confirmed.

45
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:30,833
From Dark Star to Tower.
We're ready to take off and we're asking permission.

46
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:33,670
Dark Star, the runway is yours.

47
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,272
Are you Admiral Chester Cain?

48
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:38,875
Maverick, Cain has
just entered the base.

49
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:41,544
It's not too
late to stop, man.

50
00:06:42,79 --> 00:06:44,747
You
know what will happen to you if you keep going.

51
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:49,919
I know what will happen
to you if I don't.

52
00:06:51,55 --> 00:06:53,823
Dark Star is ready to take off.

53
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:59,462
Everyone, prepare to take off.

54
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:00,396
Let's start with the engines.

55
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:02,198
- The engines are ready.
- Thermal ready.

56
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,534
- Fuel is ready.
- Mid engine ready.

57
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:08,471
- Control units are ready.
- Dark Star, you've received clearance.

58
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:10,306
All right, honey.

59
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:12,809
One last ride.

60
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:10,33
Dark Star,
you're allowed to go above 600 feet.

61
00:08:10,67 --> 00:08:11,701
Ascend 3.5 miles.

62
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,03
I'm leaving 600 feet.

63
00:08:14,38 --> 00:08:16,339
I'm climbing 3.5 miles.

64
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:23,212
Amiral...

65
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:26,682
- Just in time, sir.
- Your time is up.

66
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,184
Do you have an explanation?

67
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:29,986
I'm switching to the Seram jet.

68
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,602
- Mav wants Admiral Cain...
- He commands.

69
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,638
He orders... that we take it down.

70
00:08:50,74 --> 00:08:51,808
Alfa... Green...

71
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:54,410
Forward... value...

72
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:56,946
And mark... target...

73
00:08:57,14 --> 00:08:58,981
That 's the problem we're having with communication
, sir.

74
00:08:59,49 --> 00:09:02,118
Sometimes parasites can occur.
We are still trying to solve it.

75
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:03,820
Has anyone offered you coffee?

76
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:06,55
Pekala.

77
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,498
Currently on Mark-7. It's pushing 8.

78
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:18,267
- Flight data?
- Receiving. Data is in good condition.

79
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,875
The temperature is rising.
Values ​​are still stable.

80
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,477
We will not have any problems.

81
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:31,714
Mark-8.8.

82
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:33,716
8.9.

83
00:09:34,51 --> 00:09:35,251
Locked to 9.0.

84
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:37,720
He is the fastest man alive.

85
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,241
Talk to me, Goose.

86
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,611
Mark 9.1.

87
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:12,255
Mark 9.3.

88
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:15,758
Mark 9.4.

89
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,428
Approaching high hypersonic
velocity.

90
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,209
Windshield heat shield.

91
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:43,786
The surface temperature is rising.

92
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,160
Come on, honey. A little more.

93
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:53,496
a little more.

94
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,167
Hadi!

95
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,808
Hadi!

96
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,948
- Mark 10!
- Yes!

97
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:16,552
Take your budget cut!!

98
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:19,255
Efendim.

99
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,168
Don't do it. Do not do this...

100
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,36
Sadece...

101
00:11:35,38 --> 00:11:38,07
... a little push...

102
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:43,779
Hassiktir be...

103
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:55,491
It takes balls to do this.

104
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,460
You have to give your due.

105
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,330
PRESS TO RESET MAIN ALARM

106
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:02,832
Hassiktir...

107
00:12:07,904 --> 00:12:09,472
Maverick?

108
00:12:11,08 --> 00:12:12,408
Maverick?

109
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:03,626
Thank you.

110
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:05,728
Neredeyim ben?

111
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:08,264
İrlanda.

112
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:23,979
Maverick.

113
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,816
More than 30 years of service.

114
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:30,586
War medals. Notifications...

115
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:35,424
The only man to have shot down 3 enemy
planes in the last 40 years.

116
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:41,664
Outstanding effort.

117
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,633
But you don't get promoted.

118
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:46,369
You are not retiring.

119
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:49,271
And no matter how hard you try
, you refuse to die.

120
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:52,608
You should at least
be a two-star admiral by now.

121
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,543
Or a senator.

122
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:56,645
But here you are.

123
00:13:57,781 --> 00:13:59,281
Yüzbaşı.

124
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:01,417
Why is that?

125
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:03,819
That's one of life's mysteries
, sir.

126
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:07,189
This is not a joke.
I asked you a question.

127
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:11,260
I'm where I belong, sir.

128
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:14,463
The Navy
doesn't see it that way.

129
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:16,766
Not anymore.

130
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:21,170
Those planes you're testing
, Captain...

131
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:25,274
Someday
soon there will be no need for pilots at all.

132
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:29,311
To the pilots who need to ﻿sleep, eat, pee.

133
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,916
To the pilots who disobeyed orders.

134
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:38,20
All you did was buy those guys out there
some time.

135
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:42,124
But the future is on its way.

136
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,193
And you are not in it.

137
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:48,631
Best
to send these guys from base.

138
00:14:49,32 --> 00:14:50,833
take to headquarters.

139
00:14:51,01 --> 00:14:53,969
Say goodbye to them ﻿while you pack your things .

140
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,08
I want them on their way to Northern Ireland in an hour
.

141
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,447
To Northern Ireland, sir?

142
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:06,882
A call came ﻿at the perfect time .

143
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:11,86
Just when I came here
to punish you forever.

144
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:14,857
I don't feel comfortable saying that.

145
00:15:16,59 --> 00:15:20,362
But I can say that he owes ﻿his guardian angel .

146
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:24,967
You've been recalled to Top Gun.

147
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:31,640
- Sir?
- You can go, Captain.

148
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,715
Penultimate, none, Maverick.

149
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,418
Your species is doomed to extinction.

150
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:47,656
It may be so, sir.

151
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:50,659
But not today.

152
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:03,105
San Diego, Califomia
Fightertown U.S.A

153
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,835
Pacific Fleet
Naval Air Force

154
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:54,957
Tom "Iceman" Kazansky
, Commander of the Pacific Fleet

155
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,394
Yüzbaşı Pete
"Maverick" Mitchell.

156
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,330
Your fame precedes you.

157
00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:03,499
Thank you, sir.

158
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:06,168
It wasn't a compliment.

159
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:09,705
Ben Amiral Beau
Simpson. Hava patronuyum.

160
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:11,106
Yardımcım Solomon Bates.

161
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:12,708
Warlock, sir?

162
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:15,210
I have to say I didn't expect to be called back
.

163
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:17,680
These are called "orders"
, Maverick.

164
00:17:18,81 --> 00:17:19,848
You two have something in common.

165
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,551
The "Cyclone" next to me
was best-in-class in 1988.

166
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:25,421
I actually
finished second, sir.

167
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:27,656
I just wanted to meet expectations
.

168
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,562
Let's get to the goal.

169
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,900
An unauthorized uranium
enrichment plant.

170
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:40,502
It was built in violation ﻿of numerous NATO agreements .

171
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,404
The uranium produced there...

172
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:45,574
... poses a direct threat to ﻿our allies in the region .

173
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:49,44
The Pentagon has given us the task of forming an assault team to ﻿destroy it .

174
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:51,480
before it is ﻿fully operational .

175
00:17:51,915 --> 00:17:55,684
The facility is located in an underground bunker ﻿behind this mountain .

176
00:17:55,986 --> 00:18:00,689
GPS does not work in the valley and is surrounded by
heat-seeking missiles.

177
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:03,225
There are also a limited number of 5th generation
fighters in the vicinity.

178
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:07,463
There are attack helicopters
and vintage aircraft for support purposes.

179
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:09,765
There are even a few old F-14s.

180
00:18:10,33 --> 00:18:12,768
I guess we were the only ones who ﻿couldn't get rid of nostalgia .

181
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:16,238
What is your assessment, Captain?

182
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,508
Sir, normally..

183
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:22,11
... with the F-35s flying in silent mode
, this would be child's play.

184
00:18:22,45 --> 00:18:24,380
But not working GPS
throws it away.

185
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:26,949
The threat on the surface
appears to be small.

186
00:18:27,17 --> 00:18:30,686
Laser guided attack.
I think it's achievable with an F-18.

187
00:18:31,21 --> 00:18:33,589
Two bombs ﻿dropped right on target . Minimum.

188
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:36,125
4 planes flying in pairs.

189
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:38,360
There
's quite a ramp to get out of here.

190
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:41,363
We'll be in the clear for the missiles ﻿at the summit .

191
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:43,565
Even if we get out of here...

192
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:45,901
... there is a dogfight ﻿until we get home .

193
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:49,338
You have everything you have learned from ﻿experience .

194
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:51,306
It's not the same task, sir.

195
00:18:58,48 --> 00:19:00,215
There seems to be no ﻿going back from this .

196
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,518
Can it be done or not?

197
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,420
How long does it take for the facility
to become fully operational?

198
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:07,556
three weeks. Maybe less.

199
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:10,426
It's been a while since I 've driven an F-18
and...

200
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:14,296
...for the other three pilots,
I'm not sure who I can trust.

201
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,165
But I'm
trying to find a way out.

202
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:18,200
I think you misunderstood, Captain.

203
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:21,336
- Sir?
- We're not asking you to fly.

204
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:23,839
We want a teacher.

205
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:27,09
To teach, sir?

206
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:31,780
We recruited the best 12 pilots
from their battalions.

207
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:34,583
We want you to get your numbers down to 6
.

208
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:37,52
In the mission they will fly.

209
00:19:39,22 --> 00:19:40,923
Is there a problem, Captain?

210
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:44,693
Do you know ﻿who he is , sir?

211
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:48,97
Bradley Bradshaw.

212
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:51,834
Nicknamed "Rooster". You
've flown with his father before.

213
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:53,335
What was his nickname?

214
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,604
"Goose" efendim.

215
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:58,707
- What happened was so tragic.
- There's something wrong with Captain Mitchell...

216
00:19:59,08 --> 00:20:01,110
... it was determined that he did not do it and that his death was
an accident.

217
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:02,478
What do you say, Captain?

218
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:04,880
Will you take Goose's son?

219
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:11,120
With all due respect , I
'm not a teacher, sir.

220
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:12,588
You were a Top Gun
instructor before.

221
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,857
That was 30 years ago
and it took two months.

222
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:16,792
That's not my place.

223
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,794
Let me be as clear as possible.

224
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:22,231
You were not my first choice.
You're not the only one on the list.

225
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:25,601
You are here at the ﻿request of Admiral Kazansky .

226
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:29,738
Iceman is someone I
respect a lot.

227
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:32,508
He seems to think you have something left ﻿to offer the Navy .

228
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:35,744
But I can't imagine it.

229
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,914
You don't have to accept this job.

230
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:40,849
But let me be clear.

231
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:43,819
This will be your last mission, Captain.

232
00:20:44,788 --> 00:20:48,857
You either fly for Top Gun, or you
never fly again for the Navy.

233
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:14,82
It didn't go very well.

234
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:21,190
The child is not ready for this task.

235
00:21:22,392 --> 00:21:24,760
Nobody?

236
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:27,529
That's why you're here.

237
00:21:30,33 --> 00:21:33,135
You could have warned me.

238
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:37,206
Would you come then?

239
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:42,845
You must be kidding.

240
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:46,582
Pete.

241
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:48,917
Penny?

242
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:53,322
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same.

243
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:55,424
It's a long story.

244
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,60
- I doubt it.
- Yes...

245
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:01,63
- Who did you piss off this time?
- Another Admiral.

246
00:22:01,97 --> 00:22:02,931
It sure is.

247
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:07,269
- Are you angry with me?
- Oh, Pete...

248
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:09,838
I can never stay mad at you.

249
00:22:09,873 --> 00:22:11,406
That's the problem.

250
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:16,945
I never thought I 'd run into ﻿you in Northern Ireland .

251
00:22:18,14 --> 00:22:21,49
- How long have you been here?
- It's been 3 years since I bought this place.

252
00:22:21,84 --> 00:22:22,484
3 years?

253
00:22:22,518 --> 00:22:27,222
Shortly after you angered the other Admiral and was driven into the desert
.

254
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:30,259
Was this 3 years ago?

255
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:33,896
You must be in big trouble.

256
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,365
It is not possible for you to come here willingly
.

257
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:39,935
Neyse...

258
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:41,770
You will find a way.

259
00:22:42,71 --> 00:22:43,805
No, I guess..

260
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:45,941
I think I'm done.

261
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:47,709
Hadi, Pete.

262
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:49,711
I know you , you
're saying this since I got to know you.

263
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:54,82
You said you'd take me for a ride in that F-18
.

264
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,885
And I saw that you are going to Bosnia.

265
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:58,987
And Iraq.

266
00:22:59,22 --> 00:23:00,555
Both times.

267
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,524
You got yourself in trouble.

268
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:05,794
Iceman made a phone call
and you're back here.

269
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:07,62
Penny, this is different.

270
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,97
Pete, trust me.

271
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:10,866
Given the current odds...

272
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:14,770
somehow you'll be in a fighter plane ﻿with your tail on fire.

273
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:18,73
- Penny...
- It's too late.

274
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:21,710
- What?
- You're about to ask when I'm leaving.

275
00:23:25,81 --> 00:23:27,15
Don't give me that look.

276
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,117
I'm not looking at you.

277
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:30,786
I swear.

278
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:33,288
The end is always the same for us, Pete.

279
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:36,858
Let's not start this time.

280
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,197
Peki.

281
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:44,199
Peki.

282
00:23:48,371 --> 00:23:50,172
you look good.

283
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:01,750
Thank you very much, mate.

284
00:24:04,454 --> 00:24:05,854
What am I missing?

285
00:24:08,191 --> 00:24:14,62
- If you disrespect a woman or put her phone down...
- Drinks are on you next.

286
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:15,297
Herkese mi?

287
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:18,600
Rules are rules, I'm afraid.
You're lucky it's early.

288
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:21,303
If so!

289
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:23,638
Who is that here?

290
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,309
Yüzbaşı Phoenix.

291
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:30,112
I thought they ﻿only got the specials here , Coyote.

292
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:34,483
It turns out that
they were inviting anyone who came before them.

293
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:37,519
- Gentlemen, this is friend Bagman.
- Hangman.

294
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:38,920
Well, anyway.

295
00:24:39,55 --> 00:24:43,191
You're looking at the only Navy team that ﻿has taken down an enemy during active duty .

296
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:44,659
- Stop.
- Came to mind...

297
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:47,429
Yours is in a museum,
right? from the Korean War.

298
00:24:47,497 --> 00:24:51,66
- Cold War.
- It was in the same century, after all.

299
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,534
Not in this century.

300
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:55,404
- Who are your friends?
- Payback. - Fanboy.

301
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:57,339
- Hey, Coyote.
- Hey.

302
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:59,474
- Who is this?
- Who is who?

303
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:03,912
When did you come in?

304
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,214
I was always here already.

305
00:25:06,516 --> 00:25:09,184
- The man is a silent flight pilot.
- Literally.

306
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:11,319
Weapons systems officer, actually.

307
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:13,789
With no sense of humor.

308
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:18,193
- What do they call you?
- Bob.

309
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:19,995
No, that's your nickname.

310
00:25:22,565 --> 00:25:24,366
Bob.

311
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,234
Bob Floyd.

312
00:25:26,302 --> 00:25:28,403
Will you sit behind me?

313
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:31,473
- From LeMoire?
- It seems so.

314
00:25:35,144 --> 00:25:36,912
Masaya gel, Bob.

315
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,281
Vur hadi.

316
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:41,917
Tamam.

317
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:44,386
- Penny, dear?
- Yes.

318
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,855
You write ﻿four more on the old rifle .

319
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:04,773
Bradshaw!

320
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:07,342
is that you?

321
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:14,916
Is this how I would find out that you still fly
?

322
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:17,152
Yeah, I thought I'd ﻿surprise you .

323
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:22,257
I guess I
surprised you too.

324
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:25,694
- Good to see you.
- You too.

325
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:29,731
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

326
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:31,800
Thanks, daddy.

327
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:42,177
Shall we close the account before they rob me
of it?

328
00:26:56,58 --> 00:26:59,394
Bradshaw? Bloody before me.

329
00:26:59,662 --> 00:27:03,131
hangman? You look good.

330
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,334
İyiyim, Rooster.

331
00:27:08,70 --> 00:27:10,405
I am very good. Even...

332
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:12,874
I'm too good to be true.

333
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:16,645
Do any of you know the subject of ﻿this special gathering ?

334
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:18,413
Duty is duty.

335
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,482
It's not a problem for me.

336
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:23,552
What I want to know...
is who will be the team leader.

337
00:27:24,487 --> 00:27:26,955
And which of you
has what it takes.

338
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:28,823
to follow me.

339
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,861
Hangman,
the only place to go after you is an early grave.

340
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:44,506
If the one who follows you...

341
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,107
...runs out of fuel...

342
00:27:46,175 --> 00:27:49,10
Do you remember last year
, Rooster?

343
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:51,813
He wanted so much to show ﻿himself in that test .

344
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:54,683
You were waiting for the right moment.

345
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,420
The one who never came.

346
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:03,692
I love this.

347
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:12,434
This hasn't changed.

348
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:15,804
No. Unchanged.

349
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:21,376
Look at this.

350
00:28:21,477 --> 00:28:23,578
More pilots.

351
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:27,182
Harvard, Yale,
Omaha... Fuck it, that's Fritz.

352
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:29,84
What kind of task is this?

353
00:28:30,19 --> 00:28:32,287
That's not the question we should be asking.

354
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:35,223
Everyone here is one of the best.

355
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,560
Who will they hire to ﻿teach us ?

356
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,732
The map is worth it.

357
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,467
You're kidding.

358
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,483
Hey guys.

359
00:29:01,517 --> 00:29:03,184
Come on like this.

360
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,333
The one on me ...

361
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:21,36
That's not enough.

362
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,643
I'll be back ﻿tomorrow with cash .

363
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:30,712
Korkarım ki ...

364
00:29:30,713 --> 00:29:33,148
...rules are rules, Pete.

365
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,721
Let's throw it out!

366
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:42,190
- Let's throw it out!
- Are you serious?

367
00:29:42,224 --> 00:29:43,825
Let's throw it out!

368
00:29:47,296 --> 00:29:52,867
Let's throw it out!

369
00:29:54,437 --> 00:29:56,471
It was good to see you, Pete.

370
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:01,276
Let's throw it out!

371
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:03,178
Evet!

372
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:05,580
Thanks for the beers. Come
back whenever you want.

373
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:09,344
İrtifa 8.000.

374
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:11,413
I'm falling fast

375
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:13,81
I can't reach the launch arm.

376
00:31:13,115 --> 00:31:15,250
Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!

377
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:22,657
Goose! Dayan!

378
00:31:22,992 --> 00:31:25,927
He loved flying with you
, Maverick.

379
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:11,139
Dikkat!

380
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:23,351
Günaydın.

381
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:25,420
Welcome to your ﻿special education continent.

382
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:27,55
Oturun.

383
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:30,91
This is Air Commander Admiral Bates.

384
00:32:30,92 --> 00:32:32,293
You're all Top Gun graduates.

385
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:34,362
You are elite pilots.

386
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:36,397
You are the best of the best.

387
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:38,666
These are yesterday.

388
00:32:39,01 --> 00:32:43,538
The enemy's new 5th generation fighter
jet has leveled the playing field.

389
00:32:43,572 --> 00:32:45,607
Details are few, but
now its technological advantage...

390
00:32:45,608 --> 00:32:47,675
...
you can rest assured that we don't have it.

391
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,845
Success is now more
than ever...

392
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,915
... attached to a woman or a man ﻿inside a box .

393
00:32:54,216 --> 00:32:56,718
Half of you
will pass the elimination.

394
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,420
One of you will be designated as the mission leader
.

395
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:02,323
The remaining half
will remain as reinforcements.

396
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:05,527
Your instructor is also a
Top Gun graduate.

397
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:09,931
He has real-world experience in ﻿every mission you are expected to master .

398
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:13,568
Their achievements are legendary.

399
00:33:13,936 --> 00:33:17,572
He is widely regarded as one of ﻿the best pilots this program has produced .

400
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,840
oh my god.

401
00:33:20,175 --> 00:33:25,380
What they teach you can make
the difference between your death and your life.

402
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:28,216
Introducing Captain
Pete Mitchell.

403
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:31,586
Lakabı, Maverick.

404
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:38,293
Günaydın.

405
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:47,535
FAT guides.

406
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:52,173
It contains everything they want you to ﻿know about the program .

407
00:33:52,608 --> 00:33:55,577
I assume you know ﻿the contents of this book .

408
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:58,12
- That's right!
- Yes, we know.

409
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:08,389
Your enemy knows too.

410
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:10,325
Here we go.

411
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:13,61
But what the enemy doesn't know...

412
00:34:13,62 --> 00:34:14,862
... your limits.

413
00:34:15,197 --> 00:34:16,497
I intend to find them.

414
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:20,768
I want to test and force.

415
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,571
Just what you know today..

416
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:26,07
... we'll start with your chests.

417
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,243
Show me what
you can do.

418
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,450
Rooster?

419
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,885
Bradley?

420
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,988
Teğmen Bradshaw?

421
00:34:41,523 --> 00:34:43,124
Yes, sir.

422
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:45,560
Let's leave this formality
aside.

423
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:48,429
Are you going to kick me out of the team?

424
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:51,399
It's up to you, not me.

425
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:55,303
can i go

426
00:35:12,54 --> 00:35:14,822
Good morning, Airmen.
Your captain is speaking.

427
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:16,924
Welcome to basic flight maneuvers.

428
00:35:18,193 --> 00:35:21,362
As reported, our
exercise today is dogfighting.

429
00:35:21,397 --> 00:35:23,131
Guns only. No missiles.

430
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:26,934
We will not go below the 5,000 feet limit
.

431
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:30,338
You have to work as a team and
shoot me or else...

432
00:35:30,372 --> 00:35:31,839
Or what, sir?

433
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:33,541
Or I will shoot you.

434
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:36,244
If I shoot one of you,
you both lose.

435
00:35:36,311 --> 00:35:38,346
This guy's ego
check

436
00:35:38,414 --> 00:35:39,914
We'll handle it.

437
00:35:40,15 --> 00:35:41,582
Let's make the game a little better,
shall we?

438
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:45,353
- What's on your mind?
- Whoever gets hit first should do 200 push-ups.

439
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:48,22
I don't like doing push-ups.

440
00:35:48,123 --> 00:35:50,858
They don't call it exercise
for nothing, sir.

441
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:52,794
Agreed then, gentlemen.

442
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:54,962
The fight has begun. Let's go to work.

443
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:58,32
Fanboy, do you see it?

444
00:35:58,67 --> 00:35:59,701
There's nothing ahead on the radar.

445
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:01,602
It must be somewhere behind us.

446
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:05,306
- It's bad!
- Whoa!

447
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:06,641
No more!

448
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:12,46
Ağır ol, Maverick.

449
00:36:12,81 --> 00:36:14,482
Let's not get fired from day one.

450
00:36:14,516 --> 00:36:16,884
Charlie, down! Down!
Maverick is coming!

451
00:36:16,952 --> 00:36:19,53
- Let's break up!
- Let's break up!

452
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:23,57
Hangman, where's your fireman?

453
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,526
- Rooster, where are you?
- I've got your back, man.

454
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,729
I'm coming. Hold on, hold on!

455
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:29,697
Acele and, dostum! And Acele!

456
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,335
We have to leave!

457
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:35,837
do you see it?

458
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:38,573
Rooster just
saw the light, fellas.

459
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,141
And it cost him dearly.

460
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:41,909
Not this time, old man.

461
00:36:44,546 --> 00:36:46,380
You cannot escape like this.

462
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:51,219
damn it.

463
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,690
Rooster, you're way down.
You're under the limit!

464
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:58,359
Hassiktir!

465
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:03,598
Öldün.

466
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:04,899
Woe to your mother.

467
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:06,701
189.

468
00:37:07,69 --> 00:37:09,437
That's how it is. 190...

469
00:37:11,473 --> 00:37:13,40
We should have been there.

470
00:37:13,41 --> 00:37:14,942
But we are not.

471
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:17,779
And now you know something ﻿about the Rooster .

472
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:22,183
We'll get another one when we get back
, okay?

473
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:24,18
OK, pose.

474
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,55
- You're dead.
- Damn!

475
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,324
- You were shot.
- Wow!

476
00:37:30,893 --> 00:37:34,295
Everything feels fun until you get hit
.

477
00:37:34,363 --> 00:37:37,899
Phoenix, how about you tell everyone what Bob stands
for?

478
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,133
- No need to hide.
- I'm in.

479
00:37:39,168 --> 00:37:40,301
Don't get hooked, Bob.

480
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,69
Wanna know why we call him Hangman
?

481
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:44,739
Wait, wait, I found it.
"Baby Sitting Here."

482
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:48,643
Hassiktir lan!

483
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:50,978
Good morning, Airmen.

484
00:37:51,46 --> 00:37:52,380
The fight has begun.

485
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:54,849
All right, Phoenix.
Let's get this guy down.

486
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:56,284
Arkanı kolla, Phoenix.

487
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:58,486
- Right wing!
- I'm breaking to the right!

488
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:02,890
- Where is this going?
- That's why we call him Hangman.

489
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,692
It always leaves you in the middle.

490
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:06,828
It means leaving your ﻿burning man .

491
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:08,930
A tactic I haven't seen in a ﻿long time .

492
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:11,65
He called you a man, Phoenix.
Will you accept this?

493
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:13,00
Unless he calls you a man.

494
00:38:13,35 --> 00:38:16,604
- Where's Maverick, Bob?
- God, his nose almost went in.

495
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:18,873
Get him after me, Hangman!

496
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:20,708
To the attention of our viewers at home.

497
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:22,610
That's how fossils are buried.

498
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:24,812
All right, Hangman. It's time to teach you
a lesson.

499
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,181
- You're dead, Phoenix.
- Son of a bitch!

500
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:31,285
Let's go, Mav!
Let's see what you got!

501
00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:32,753
Come on!

502
00:38:34,22 --> 00:38:36,457
You'll be done soon.
Hangman is coming.

503
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,660
Yes, we will see it.

504
00:38:46,34 --> 00:38:49,437
It's sensitive. Phoenix can't see it.
How close am I?

505
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:52,39
- Phoenix?
- I'm dead, dickhead.

506
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,75
See you in the afterlife, Bagman.

507
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,278
Where is this? Where?

508
00:38:57,646 --> 00:38:59,180
Öldün.

509
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:00,948
79!

510
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:02,383
Yere! 80!

511
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:04,819
All right, who's next?

512
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:07,722
- I shot you, Omaha.
- Damn!

513
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:11,92
Vuruldun, Coyote.

514
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,827
This must be a joke.

515
00:39:13,128 --> 00:39:15,229
Yere! 71!

516
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:17,431
Yere! 72!

517
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:22,870
Rooster, can I ask you a personal
question?

518
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,772
If I say you can't ask,
won't you ask?

519
00:39:24,806 --> 00:39:26,741
What's your story with Maverick?

520
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:28,442
It seems like it got you a little nervous
.

521
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,212
- It's none of your business.
- Where is this man?

522
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:33,80
I was always here.

523
00:39:34,316 --> 00:39:36,817
Hassiktir be...

524
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:40,21
Do you see now?

525
00:39:40,322 --> 00:39:42,490
Come on, let's finish this thing.

526
00:39:42,824 --> 00:39:44,392
The fight has begun!

527
00:39:46,94 --> 00:39:48,529
What's wrong with these two?

528
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:54,969
Well, you got us here.

529
00:39:55,37 --> 00:39:56,537
How will you remove yourself?

530
00:39:56,972 --> 00:39:59,06
You can quit whenever you want!

531
00:39:59,41 --> 00:40:02,443
- How long do you want to continue, Rooster?
- I can do as much as you, sir.

532
00:40:02,477 --> 00:40:04,211
And that's enough for me.

533
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:09,750
The past is past
. for both of us.

534
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:11,519
You want to believe that
, right?

535
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:14,722
You go below the limit.
Your space is running low!

536
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:19,293
If you want to see us both on the ground
, so be it.

537
00:40:20,95 --> 00:40:22,730
altitude! Altitude!

538
00:40:24,499 --> 00:40:28,803
altitude! Altitude!

539
00:40:32,507 --> 00:40:34,408
Rise, rise!

540
00:40:35,577 --> 00:40:37,545
Rise, rise!

541
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,782
That's how it is. Don't think, just do.

542
00:40:42,284 --> 00:40:45,19
Come on, Rooster. You're on your back!
Get down and take your shot!

543
00:40:46,755 --> 00:40:48,155
I'm so low!

544
00:40:49,224 --> 00:40:50,758
It's too late now. You missed your chance.

545
00:40:56,598 --> 00:40:58,199
Öldün.

546
00:40:58,433 --> 00:40:59,700
Yere in.

547
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:01,235
damn it!

548
00:41:01,303 --> 00:41:03,371
It's the same Rooster.

549
00:41:06,74 --> 00:41:08,476
Go see Harlow ﻿for your push-ups .

550
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:18,319
OK, that's enough.

551
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,721
Rooster, that's enough, man.

552
00:41:34,936 --> 00:41:37,505
Going below the limit
? Disobedience?

553
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:39,807
- Trying to get fired?
- Don't worry about it.

554
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:41,842
Bak...

555
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:43,778
I'm going on this mission.

556
00:41:44,112 --> 00:41:47,481
But if you get fired, you
leave us to fly Hangman.

557
00:41:47,516 --> 00:41:49,216
Talk to me! What was it?

558
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:51,18
He took out my papers.

559
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,788
Ne? Kim?

560
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:55,389
Maverick.

561
00:41:55,757 --> 00:41:58,459
He took out my application and
sent it back.

562
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,862
It pushed me back four years.

563
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:06,00
Why would you do this?

564
00:42:11,06 --> 00:42:14,75
The limit is 5000
feet above the ground.

565
00:42:14,142 --> 00:42:16,310
This limit is not just
for the safety of the pilots...

566
00:42:16,344 --> 00:42:17,812
... determined for the safety of ﻿aircraft as well .

567
00:42:18,46 --> 00:42:20,948
5000 feet is not an ordinary
rule, it is a law.

568
00:42:21,49 --> 00:42:22,383
It must be obeyed like the law of gravity!

569
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,718
The limit for the mission will be much
lower, sir.

570
00:42:24,786 --> 00:42:28,189
And it cannot be changed without my consent
!

571
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,324
Especially in the
middle of a workout.

572
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:32,460
And that cobra maneuver?

573
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:33,961
He could have killed all three of you.

574
00:42:34,29 --> 00:42:36,97
I never want to see ﻿this bullshit again.

575
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:39,400
What exactly did you
think you were teaching, Captain?

576
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:41,902
No matter how good they are, they
still have something to learn, sir.

577
00:42:42,70 --> 00:42:44,572
You're talking about the best fighter-plane
pilots on the planet, Captain.

578
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,807
And
their careers that will end with them.

579
00:42:46,842 --> 00:42:49,977
They will drop bombs from high altitude with little or no
dogfight.

580
00:42:50,345 --> 00:42:53,47
The parameters of this mission
require things for which they were never prepared.

581
00:42:53,81 --> 00:42:55,116
To fight as a team
and to a goal...

582
00:42:55,183 --> 00:42:56,851
...to teach how to attack...

583
00:42:56,885 --> 00:42:58,853
... you have less than three weeks.

584
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,88
And for their safe return home.

585
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:06,460
They'll be back home safely
, sir.

586
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,501
Every mission has risks.

587
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:16,103
These pilots accept that.

588
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:18,72
I don't, sir.

589
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:25,713
Starting today, you will give us your training plans in writing ﻿every morning .

590
00:43:25,747 --> 00:43:28,983
And nothing will be changed ﻿without my written consent .

591
00:43:29,17 --> 00:43:32,386
- Including the limit, sir?
- Especially the limit, Captain.

592
00:43:34,356 --> 00:43:35,556
Efendim.

593
00:43:35,957 --> 00:43:37,91
What is this?

594
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,926
Request to lower the limit, sir.

595
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:42,563
For low altitude bomb drill in ﻿mission parameters .

596
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:50,337
You better learn a few things about timing
, Captain.

597
00:43:50,705 --> 00:43:52,339
Hey, Coyote.

598
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,308
Take a look at this.

599
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,481
The man is a legend. It's over there.

600
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:02,716
No, no. next to it.

601
00:44:03,818 --> 00:44:06,153
Is it familiar?

602
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:09,523
What is it here?

603
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:11,926
Bradshaw.

604
00:44:12,227 --> 00:44:14,995
It's like a living tomb.

605
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:19,233
Hey, Theo.

606
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:22,736
- But you've grown.
- Hey, Mav.

607
00:44:28,743 --> 00:44:32,246
- Emilia?
- I know. I've grown a lot.

608
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,747
Evet.

609
00:44:34,49 --> 00:44:36,16
If you want a drink, get it yourself.

610
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,619
No, I stopped
by to pay my debt.

611
00:44:38,653 --> 00:44:40,154
Anne!

612
00:44:44,326 --> 00:44:47,728
- Hey, how's your dad?
- He's in Hawaii with his wife.

613
00:44:47,762 --> 00:44:49,363
Anne!

614
00:44:49,764 --> 00:44:51,932
Mav says he brought your money.

615
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,134
Never mind.

616
00:44:54,202 --> 00:44:55,936
I insist.

617
00:44:58,473 --> 00:45:00,374
Thank you, Captain.

618
00:45:00,408 --> 00:45:02,509
Say your account is closed.

619
00:45:02,844 --> 00:45:04,878
Captain? still?

620
00:45:04,946 --> 00:45:07,481
A Captain with many medals.

621
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:10,551
Finish it. We have to get the boat
repaired.

622
00:45:10,685 --> 00:45:13,20
- I can't come.
- What do you mean you can't come?

623
00:45:13,88 --> 00:45:14,722
There is a test tomorrow. I need to work.

624
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:16,457
They reported today.

625
00:45:16,524 --> 00:45:18,726
I can't take him alone.

626
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,527
You use the engine.

627
00:45:20,562 --> 00:45:22,596
Why are we taking it for repair?

628
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:24,632
- To get the engine repaired.
- To get the engine repaired.

629
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:26,400
I can help.

630
00:45:31,806 --> 00:45:34,375
We don't always stand by like this.

631
00:45:34,709 --> 00:45:36,76
Yapma ya?

632
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:37,945
According to the wind direction..

633
00:45:37,979 --> 00:45:40,247
- ﻿...we set sail.
- OK.

634
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:42,349
What does this mean?

635
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:46,86
And you'll be in my navy!

636
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:48,355
I'm not driving, Penny.

637
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,57
I'm landing on them.

638
00:45:50,91 --> 00:45:53,227
No more difficult than steering an airplane.

639
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:55,29
How will I do it?

640
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,232
Pulling the green rope over there.

641
00:45:58,266 --> 00:45:59,867
Yeşil halat ...

642
00:46:01,603 --> 00:46:03,637
Yes, pull hard!

643
00:46:03,705 --> 00:46:06,540
Uradaki kola sar!

644
00:46:06,574 --> 00:46:08,375
He will open the mainsail!

645
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,711
- Flip, with all your might!
- OK!

646
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:14,114
Güzel.

647
00:46:14,549 --> 00:46:16,383
Şimdi...

648
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:18,952
are you ready?

649
00:46:20,288 --> 00:46:22,122
Neye?

650
00:46:22,424 --> 00:46:24,858
Additional speed.

651
00:46:44,312 --> 00:46:46,180
Now you're from the Navy.

652
00:47:08,69 --> 00:47:10,204
Thanks for ﻿helping out on the boat .

653
00:47:11,773 --> 00:47:13,707
I
'm not sure I'm helping.

654
00:47:18,413 --> 00:47:20,581
Don't give me that look.

655
00:47:20,648 --> 00:47:22,149
Which look?

656
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:23,817
that's it.

657
00:47:26,688 --> 00:47:28,589
Good night, Pete.

658
00:47:28,623 --> 00:47:30,524
Good night, Penny.

659
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:01,488
Time is your worst enemy.

660
00:48:02,457 --> 00:48:06,760
Stage 1 of the mission
is to advance at low altitude in two teams.

661
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:09,396
You will reach your destination through this narrow
canyon.

662
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:12,733
The area smells of radar-mounted heat
-seeking missiles.

663
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:15,536
These missiles are deadly.

664
00:48:15,937 --> 00:48:19,773
But they are designed to protect the sky above
, not the canyon below.

665
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:23,444
Because the enemy knows that no one
is crazy enough to fly under them.

666
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:26,880
That's exactly what
I'm going to train you for.

667
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:30,184
On mission day, your altitude
will be 1000 feet.

668
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:31,685
Maksimum.

669
00:48:31,753 --> 00:48:35,88
If you pass this altitude, the
radar will catch you...

670
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:37,357
...and you die.

671
00:48:38,426 --> 00:48:40,727
Your speed will be 660 knots.

672
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:42,95
Minimum.

673
00:48:42,163 --> 00:48:45,199
Arrival time at destination 2.5 minutes.

674
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:49,236
This is because of the 5th generation warplanes waiting at the ﻿nearby airport .

675
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,840
If you encounter ﻿these planes in an F-18 ...

676
00:48:53,241 --> 00:48:55,75
... you will die.

677
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,212
So
before these planes even have a chance to catch you...

678
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:01,14
... you must enter, hit your target
and disappear.

679
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:04,618
This makes time your biggest competitor.

680
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,656
Your navigation system
has a simulation of the canyon.

681
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:11,692
The faster you cross ﻿this canyon ...

682
00:49:11,693 --> 00:49:15,229
... the more difficult it will be for you to stay ﻿under the radar and stay away from enemy planes .

683
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:20,133
As the turns get harder , the
force of gravity on your body increases exponentially.

684
00:49:20,368 --> 00:49:22,569
It compresses your lungs...

685
00:49:22,604 --> 00:49:24,204
It forces the blood in your brain to flow...

686
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:27,140
It affects your decisions and
reaction time.

687
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:30,43
They asked me not to overload you.

688
00:49:30,78 --> 00:49:33,213
So your altitude is 1,300 feet
and your time to destination is 3 minutes.

689
00:49:34,282 --> 00:49:36,350
Good luck.

690
00:49:42,957 --> 00:49:44,157
Dostum...

691
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:47,227
We are 1.30 minutes
away from the destination. We're two seconds behind.

692
00:49:47,328 --> 00:49:48,562
We must increase our speed by 80 knots.

693
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:50,898
Hızlanmalıyız, Coyote.

694
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:52,866
Got it, I'm increasing the speed.

695
00:49:54,502 --> 00:49:55,969
Hassiktir!

696
00:49:59,274 --> 00:50:02,175
- Why did they die?
- We've crossed the 300-foot limit.

697
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:03,577
And the missiles took us down.

698
00:50:03,645 --> 00:50:06,780
- No. Why did they die?
- I slowed down and didn't give him a warning.

699
00:50:06,814 --> 00:50:09,483
- It was my fault.
- For not communicating with your team.

700
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:12,719
- I'm sorry, sir...
- Will their families accept this at their funeral?

701
00:50:13,621 --> 00:50:15,422
No, sir.

702
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:18,659
Why didn't you anticipate the return?
You were informed in training.

703
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:20,661
Don't tell me.

704
00:50:21,95 --> 00:50:23,230
Tell his family.

705
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:29,903
Hangman, be heavy!
The canyon narrows.

706
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:32,172
No problem,
Payback. Increase your speed.

707
00:50:33,474 --> 00:50:35,576
You're going too fast, man!

708
00:50:35,643 --> 00:50:38,78
It wouldn't hurt to arrive first.

709
00:50:39,614 --> 00:50:41,348
Damn, slow down

710
00:50:41,382 --> 00:50:42,416
I can't stay on course!

711
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:45,586
There's a wall in front of you!
Attention, attention, attention!

712
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:51,692
- What happened?
- I flew as fast as I could.

713
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,27
As if my life depended on it.

714
00:50:54,62 --> 00:50:57,230
And he put his team in danger
and your yandere is dead.

715
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:00,233
They couldn't reach me.

716
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:08,375
Rooster! We're 20 seconds
behind and it's increasing!

717
00:51:08,843 --> 00:51:10,978
we are fine! Maintain your speed.

718
00:51:11,45 --> 00:51:13,113
We're going 500 nautical miles.

719
00:51:13,214 --> 00:51:14,781
Just keep your speed.

720
00:51:14,882 --> 00:51:16,16
Rooster, we're running late!

721
00:51:16,84 --> 00:51:18,752
We're alive though. We'll make up for it later
.

722
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:20,754
Başaramayacağız!

723
00:51:20,788 --> 00:51:22,789
Listen to me! Maintain your speed.

724
00:51:22,824 --> 00:51:24,57
Başarabiliriz.

725
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:26,293
Why did you die?

726
00:51:26,327 --> 00:51:27,628
You are the team leader above.

727
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:30,163
Why did you and your team die

728
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:33,233
Sir,
he was the only one to reach the target.

729
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:34,868
One minute late.

730
00:51:35,203 --> 00:51:37,938
He gave the ﻿enemy planes time to land him .

731
00:51:37,939 --> 00:51:39,373
- He's dead.
- You can't know that.

732
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,742
You're not flying fast enough.

733
00:51:41,776 --> 00:51:43,310
We don't have a
second to waste.

734
00:51:43,378 --> 00:51:46,947
- We've reached the goal.
- And superior enemy planes...

735
00:51:46,981 --> 00:51:48,515
... cut you off while you were leaving.

736
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:51,518
- Then it's a dogfight.
- Against 5th generation warplanes.

737
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:52,819
Yes, we still have a chance.

738
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:55,689
- In an F-18.
- It's not on the plane, sir.

739
00:51:55,757 --> 00:51:58,525
- It's on the pilot.
- Exactly!

740
00:52:04,732 --> 00:52:07,601
There is more than one way to ﻿fly in this mission .

741
00:52:07,635 --> 00:52:09,603
You really don't understand.

742
00:52:09,837 --> 00:52:13,373
In this mission a man
either flies like a Maverick...

743
00:52:13,408 --> 00:52:15,676
...or he can't come back.

744
00:52:16,10 --> 00:52:18,78
There is no resentment to be offended.

745
00:52:18,146 --> 00:52:20,847
But you still
succeed every time.

746
00:52:22,216 --> 00:52:25,52
You better listen to the ﻿criticisms a little bit .

747
00:52:25,86 --> 00:52:26,119
That's all. Lieutenant...

748
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:28,422
We're going to war, son.

749
00:52:28,456 --> 00:52:30,991
The kind that no living pilot
has ever seen.

750
00:52:31,893 --> 00:52:34,94
Onun bile.

751
00:52:35,163 --> 00:52:37,831
Now is not the time to ﻿think about the past .

752
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:43,303
- What does that mean now?
- Rooster.

753
00:52:43,337 --> 00:52:46,139
I can't be the only one who knows that ﻿Maverick flew with his father .

754
00:52:46,174 --> 00:52:48,508
- That's enough.
- And while Maverick was flying with his father...

755
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:50,43
Hey! Hey!

756
00:52:50,78 --> 00:52:51,712
For sure! Enough!

757
00:52:51,746 --> 00:52:54,14
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey, come on!

758
00:52:54,82 --> 00:52:56,183
No hassle. I am fine.

759
00:52:56,718 --> 00:52:59,52
- That's enough.
- He's not fit for the job.

760
00:52:59,87 --> 00:53:01,288
- Enough!
- You know this.

761
00:53:04,258 --> 00:53:06,126
You know him, don't you?

762
00:53:11,532 --> 00:53:13,467
You can all disperse.

763
00:53:29,50 --> 00:53:31,184
We need to meet.

764
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,625
It's not a good time.

765
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:41,962
I'm not asking.

766
00:54:16,898 --> 00:54:18,965
Maverick.

767
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:22,769
It's gotten worse.

768
00:54:23,171 --> 00:54:25,205
Nobody knows.

769
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:28,909
There is nothing else I can do.

770
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:32,345
It hurts ﻿even when talking .

771
00:54:37,418 --> 00:54:39,786
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

772
00:54:59,574 --> 00:55:01,508
Amiral.

773
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:13,353
Here is my burner.

774
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,63
I want to talk about business.

775
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:27,467
Please don't worry about me.

776
00:55:27,935 --> 00:55:30,237
what can i do for you

777
00:55:31,606 --> 00:55:34,140
I want to talk about work.

778
00:55:38,12 --> 00:55:39,779
Peki.

779
00:55:42,116 --> 00:55:45,685
Rooster is
still mad at me for what I did.

780
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:49,789
I thought you'd ﻿understand why .

781
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:53,927
I hope he forgives me.

782
00:55:55,363 --> 00:55:56,62
There is still time.

783
00:56:01,802 --> 00:56:04,404
Less than three weeks to the task
.

784
00:56:04,405 --> 00:56:06,72
The child is not ready.

785
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:12,12
So teach him.

786
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:16,516
It's
not about what I can give him.

787
00:56:16,884 --> 00:56:19,185
Ice, please.

788
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,55
Don't ask me to send ﻿another person to die , please.

789
00:56:23,90 --> 00:56:25,258
Don't ask me to send it.

790
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:27,127
send me

791
00:56:40,107 --> 00:56:44,978
It's time to quit.

792
00:56:58,259 --> 00:57:00,627
I don't know how.

793
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:15,408
I'm not a teacher, Ice.

794
00:57:17,378 --> 00:57:19,713
I am a fighter jet pilot.

795
00:57:21,515 --> 00:57:23,750
The Navy wants me to train.

796
00:57:25,786 --> 00:57:28,421
I'm not this.

797
00:57:28,923 --> 00:57:30,757
This is my personality.

798
00:57:31,759 --> 00:57:34,227
How can I teach this?

799
00:57:35,529 --> 00:57:38,798
Even if I could teach,
that's not what Rooster wants.

800
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,634
That's not what the Navy wants.

801
00:57:41,702 --> 00:57:44,738
That's why they came to me last
time.

802
00:57:46,574 --> 00:57:50,243
You 're the only reason ﻿I'm here .

803
00:57:57,18 --> 00:57:59,419
If I send him on this mission...

804
00:57:59,887 --> 00:58:02,722
... he may never return home.

805
00:58:06,60 --> 00:58:08,428
And if I don't send him...

806
00:58:08,462 --> 00:58:10,730
... will never forgive me.

807
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:16,169
Either way, I
will lose him forever.

808
00:58:20,741 --> 00:58:24,244
It's time to quit.

809
00:58:25,946 --> 00:58:27,714
Biliyorum.

810
00:58:27,748 --> 00:58:29,382
Biliyorum...

811
00:58:40,194 --> 00:58:43,830
The Navy needs the Maverick.

812
00:58:45,933 --> 00:58:49,702
The boy needs Maverick.

813
00:58:50,271 --> 00:58:53,440
That's why I vouched for you.

814
00:58:54,608 --> 00:58:57,577
That's why you're still here.

815
00:59:04,852 --> 00:59:06,953
Teşekkürler, Ice.

816
00:59:07,354 --> 00:59:09,422
for everything.

817
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:15,361
One last thing.

818
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:19,232
Which of us was the better
pilot? You or me?

819
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:24,604
Let's not ruin this beautiful moment.

820
01:00:27,34 --> 01:00:29,202
Come on, here we go!

821
01:01:57,891 --> 01:02:00,193
- Sir?
- What is this?

822
01:02:00,227 --> 01:02:01,894
Dogfight football.

823
01:02:01,929 --> 01:02:03,696
Attack and defense at the same time.

824
01:02:04,98 --> 01:02:05,498
Who is winning?

825
01:02:05,566 --> 01:02:08,368
I guess they stopped keeping score a long
time ago.

826
01:02:08,669 --> 01:02:11,170
The team still has a week of
practice, Captain.

827
01:02:11,505 --> 01:02:13,373
- Every minute counts.
- Yes sir.

828
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:15,908
So why are we
playing games here?

829
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,578
You told me to form a team
, sir.

830
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,347
Here is your team.

831
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:02,915
Should I go before Emilia returns?

832
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:04,784
He's staying with his friend tonight.

833
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:11,23
You and Emilia are much more...

834
01:04:12,693 --> 01:04:15,228
...you seem close...
compared to the last time I saw it.

835
01:04:15,229 --> 01:04:18,498
Yes. We are.

836
01:04:19,867 --> 01:04:21,701
Şey...

837
01:04:22,703 --> 01:04:25,772
He wanted more freedom than ﻿I thought he was ready for .

838
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,108
Who did he get this from?

839
01:04:31,712 --> 01:04:34,814
That I should trust him...

840
01:04:34,848 --> 01:04:37,517
... I finally realized it.

841
01:04:37,885 --> 01:04:41,154
I have to let ﻿him make his own mistakes every now and then.

842
01:04:43,90 --> 01:04:45,324
It's not an easy choice.

843
01:04:49,496 --> 01:04:51,764
Is that what happened with the Rooster?

844
01:04:55,202 --> 01:04:58,304
I pulled out your paperwork from ﻿the Naval Academy .

845
01:05:00,607 --> 01:05:03,242
I stole years from your career.

846
01:05:08,615 --> 01:05:10,383
Neden?

847
01:05:12,986 --> 01:05:16,789
After what happened to Goose, I
couldn't let him fly.

848
01:05:19,193 --> 01:05:22,61
He made me promise before he died.

849
01:05:22,596 --> 01:05:24,564
Does Rooster know this?

850
01:05:27,868 --> 01:05:31,237
He will always hate me ﻿for what I did .

851
01:05:32,873 --> 01:05:35,675
Why would I send it then?

852
01:05:39,713 --> 01:05:42,381
It's not an easy choice.

853
01:05:44,852 --> 01:05:47,954
I was trying to be the ﻿father he lost .

854
01:05:50,357 --> 01:05:52,24
Sadece...

855
01:05:54,27 --> 01:05:56,696
I wish I had done it differently.

856
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,568
The truth is...

857
01:06:03,604 --> 01:06:06,572
I didn't think you were ready.

858
01:06:09,476 --> 01:06:11,944
Is it ready now?

859
01:06:14,548 --> 01:06:16,616
Mom, I'm here!

860
01:06:17,584 --> 01:06:20,219
You were supposed to stay in Caron tonight
?

861
01:06:20,254 --> 01:06:22,788
Caron was
going somewhere with her family!

862
01:06:22,823 --> 01:06:25,324
- I'd better go.
- You better go.

863
01:06:26,93 --> 01:06:28,394
Did you eat?

864
01:06:28,428 --> 01:06:31,664
No, it's okay. I
'll prepare something for you.

865
01:06:31,932 --> 01:06:33,833
I'm getting off right now!

866
01:06:34,101 --> 01:06:35,768
wait! Not from there.

867
01:06:37,137 --> 01:06:40,106
Look, I need to be an example.

868
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,108
I can't be the woman who brings a ﻿man home on a first date .

869
01:06:42,409 --> 01:06:44,143
This is not our first date!

870
01:06:44,444 --> 01:06:46,379
You know what I mean.

871
01:06:49,683 --> 01:06:51,50
Pekala.

872
01:06:51,351 --> 01:06:56,88
OK. But I'm getting out of the
window for the last time, just so you know.

873
01:06:56,323 --> 01:06:58,24
- We'll see.
- No.

874
01:06:58,91 --> 01:06:59,559
No, I'm serious.

875
01:06:59,593 --> 01:07:01,661
I will not leave you again.

876
01:07:03,397 --> 01:07:04,697
Shut up!

877
01:07:05,132 --> 01:07:06,832
Come on, get out of here!

878
01:07:20,647 --> 01:07:22,782
Is he still nagging?

879
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:35,461
Günaydın.

880
01:07:35,996 --> 01:07:37,997
Your target is the uranium
enrichment plant...

881
01:07:37,998 --> 01:07:39,999
...
will start working sooner than expected.

882
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,603
The raw uranium
will be delivered to the plant in 10 days.

883
01:07:43,971 --> 01:07:46,372
As a result, your mission
has been pushed forward a week.

884
01:07:46,406 --> 01:07:50,676
To avoid contaminating ﻿the target valley with radiation .

885
01:07:51,44 --> 01:07:53,980
Sir, no one here has successfully completed the low-altitude
course.

886
01:07:54,14 --> 01:07:56,215
Yet you have been ordered to advance.

887
01:07:56,984 --> 01:07:58,618
Yüzbaşı.

888
01:08:01,355 --> 01:08:03,723
2.
We have one week to focus on Phase .

889
01:08:03,757 --> 01:08:05,524
The most dangerous part of the mission.

890
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:09,328
A hard dive that required ﻿two miracles in a row, and...

891
01:08:09,363 --> 01:08:11,97
... to leave the package.

892
01:08:11,431 --> 01:08:14,400
Two pairs of F-
18s will advance to the target, maintaining their attack pattern.

893
01:08:14,701 --> 01:08:17,203
In order for the mission to succeed
and for you to survive...

894
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:21,674
... it is very important ﻿that these planes work in coordination and as a team.

895
01:08:21,742 --> 01:08:24,510
As you know, the facility
is between two mountains.

896
01:08:24,745 --> 01:08:28,447
In the last step, you will go straight
into a hard dive.

897
01:08:28,749 --> 01:08:32,251
This gives you the
opportunity to maintain the lowest possible altitude and...

898
01:08:32,753 --> 01:08:35,720
...will recognize a single angle of attack.

899
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:42,662
Your target is in an area of ﻿​​less than 3 meters .

900
01:08:43,663 --> 01:08:46,932
The first two aircraft will
paint the target with a laser sight.

901
01:08:48,01 --> 01:08:50,503
The first pair is placed in an exposed
vent...

902
01:08:50,537 --> 01:08:53,973
... will drop a laser-guided bomb
and hit the reactor.

903
01:08:54,07 --> 01:08:56,509
This will leave an open space ﻿for the second couple .

904
01:08:56,843 --> 01:08:58,844
This was the first miracle.

905
01:09:00,514 --> 01:09:03,616
The second team
will deliver the killing blow.

906
01:09:05,352 --> 01:09:07,153
And it will destroy the target.

907
01:09:07,487 --> 01:09:09,889
This is the second miracle.

908
01:09:10,924 --> 01:09:12,692
If either team misses the target...

909
01:09:15,328 --> 01:09:16,962
- I missed!
- Mission fails.

910
01:09:17,30 --> 01:09:18,964
damn it.

911
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:22,968
You will have to make a hard
ascent to avoid hitting the mountain.

912
01:09:25,706 --> 01:09:28,741
You'd eat at least 8 Gs on ﻿that steep ascent at that speed .

913
01:09:28,809 --> 01:09:30,376
9. Minimum.

914
01:09:30,444 --> 01:09:33,112
The fuselage of the F-18s is
designed for 7.5 G.

915
01:09:33,146 --> 01:09:34,213
That's the accepted limit.

916
01:09:34,214 --> 01:09:37,316
You will endure more ﻿to survive this mission .

917
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,819
Even if it means ﻿twisting your torso .

918
01:09:40,854 --> 01:09:44,223
Your heartbeat will accelerate and
you will feel pressure close to 4 tons.

919
01:09:44,591 --> 01:09:46,926
Your skull will crush your spine.

920
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,762
Your lungs will explode as ﻿if an elephant is sitting on your chest .

921
01:09:51,164 --> 01:09:54,200
You will fight with ﻿all your might just not to faint.

922
01:09:56,403 --> 01:09:58,838
And right here
you will be the most vulnerable.

923
01:09:59,272 --> 01:10:02,742
This is... the coffin corner.

924
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:05,511
Assuming you avoid ﻿hitting this mountain ...

925
01:10:05,545 --> 01:10:09,148
... you will go straight into enemy radar and you will
lose your privacy.

926
01:10:09,449 --> 01:10:12,284
Within seconds, enemy
missiles will be fired at you.

927
01:10:13,353 --> 01:10:16,455
You've all had
a malfunction in the air before...

928
01:10:16,823 --> 01:10:19,859
...but this will bring you to the point of destroying ﻿both you and your plane .

929
01:10:20,227 --> 01:10:23,129
Sir, can this task be
accomplished?

930
01:10:23,163 --> 01:10:25,264
The answer to this question is...

931
01:10:25,632 --> 01:10:28,267
Depends on the pilot in the box.

932
01:10:37,444 --> 01:10:39,945
- Talk to me, Bob.
- We're 12 seconds late to the destination.

933
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,213
- We have to speed up. We must speed up.
- Fuck it.

934
01:10:41,248 --> 01:10:42,782
Got it.
Try to stay with me .

935
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,120
Who is this?

936
01:10:49,89 --> 01:10:50,689
Blue Team, your place has been determined.

937
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:53,125
- Fuck it, it's Maverick.
- What is he doing here?

938
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,194
I am an enemy plane ﻿coming to intercept you.

939
01:10:55,262 --> 01:10:56,462
Blue Team, what will you do?

940
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:59,498
20 km. away, in the direction of 10.
It's not too close.

941
01:10:59,533 --> 01:11:01,167
You have the word. What would you like to do?

942
01:11:01,434 --> 01:11:03,502
We continue. We're close.

943
01:11:03,537 --> 01:11:04,870
Hedefte kal

944
01:11:04,905 --> 01:11:06,639
turned north

945
01:11:06,673 --> 01:11:09,41
- Prepare for ascension.
- Stand by at the laser, Bob.

946
01:11:09,75 --> 01:11:10,409
Got it, I'm waiting.

947
01:11:11,344 --> 01:11:13,679
Blue Team, the enemy
is still approaching.

948
01:11:13,713 --> 01:11:15,114
I'm rising now!

949
01:11:21,54 --> 01:11:23,289
Congratulations, Bob! Maverick down?

950
01:11:23,323 --> 01:11:25,291
10 km. away, coming fast!

951
01:11:31,464 --> 01:11:32,731
In the target field of view.

952
01:11:32,766 --> 01:11:34,99
Where's my laser, Bob?

953
01:11:34,401 --> 01:11:36,35
Does not lock, does not lock!

954
01:11:36,69 --> 01:11:37,736
It doesn't work. Sorry, I can't
lock it!

955
01:11:37,838 --> 01:11:39,772
So I'm shooting blind!

956
01:11:43,109 --> 01:11:44,376
Damn, I missed!

957
01:11:55,822 --> 01:11:58,57
- I shot you.
- Leave me alone, brothers.

958
01:11:58,124 --> 01:11:59,792
It's silly, we're dead.

959
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:01,961
Blue Team, you failed.

960
01:12:01,962 --> 01:12:03,495
Balance your wings, Coyote.

961
01:12:05,599 --> 01:12:07,399
Coyote, balance your wings!

962
01:12:10,303 --> 01:12:12,271
Coyote, answer!

963
01:12:12,672 --> 01:12:14,874
Coyote, balance your wings!

964
01:12:15,242 --> 01:12:16,775
He's sick, he's unconscious.

965
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,878
Coyote?!

966
01:12:18,945 --> 01:12:20,412
Çakılacak!

967
01:12:20,447 --> 01:12:22,14
I'm chasing after you!

968
01:12:25,118 --> 01:12:27,653
Hadi, his ver bana! Its worms!

969
01:12:27,888 --> 01:12:30,189
Get rid of it, Coyote.

970
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,928
Until, Coyote. Until, until!

971
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,931
Cevap ver, Coyote!

972
01:12:39,299 --> 01:12:41,33
Coyote! Coyote!

973
01:12:46,206 --> 01:12:47,873
Coyote, are you okay?

974
01:12:48,909 --> 01:12:52,177
İyiyim.

975
01:12:52,212 --> 01:12:53,979
Beautiful, beautiful.

976
01:12:54,14 --> 01:12:55,848
Enough for today.

977
01:12:56,883 --> 01:12:58,684
This was close.

978
01:12:59,52 --> 01:13:00,419
He was too close.

979
01:13:00,453 --> 01:13:02,321
flock of birds! Herd of birds

980
01:13:03,89 --> 01:13:04,623
A flock of birds?

981
01:13:07,727 --> 01:13:09,695
Phoenix, right engine on fire!

982
01:13:09,729 --> 01:13:11,96
Yükseliyorum!

983
01:13:12,98 --> 01:13:13,198
I'm speeding.

984
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,234
I turn off the fuel on the right engine.

985
01:13:15,268 --> 01:13:16,702
I'm putting out the fire.

986
01:13:18,972 --> 01:13:21,40
- Right engine stalled.
- It's still spinning.

987
01:13:21,107 --> 01:13:22,374
I'm trying to reboot.

988
01:13:23,476 --> 01:13:25,644
Your tail is on fire!
Make a sharp turn!

989
01:13:25,712 --> 01:13:27,46
Hızlanıyorum.

990
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:29,782
damn it.

991
01:13:32,452 --> 01:13:34,253
We are burning. We're on fire!

992
01:13:34,354 --> 01:13:36,221
- Damn it!
- Fire in the engine.

993
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:38,791
I'm extinguishing both engines!

994
01:13:41,294 --> 01:13:43,529
Phoenix, Bob! Jump, jump!

995
01:13:43,563 --> 01:13:45,764
There are malfunctions everywhere!
All values ​​are dropping!

996
01:13:45,799 --> 01:13:47,733
- System malfunction.
- I can't control it.

997
01:13:47,767 --> 01:13:50,135
We're falling, Phoenix? We're falling!

998
01:13:50,337 --> 01:13:53,72
You have no other chance!
Throw it! Throw it!

999
01:13:53,139 --> 01:13:55,941
Throw it! Throw it!

1000
01:14:17,864 --> 01:14:21,900
They will watch them for a while longer.

1001
01:14:21,935 --> 01:14:23,535
But they will be fine.

1002
01:14:27,40 --> 01:14:28,640
Kaybettik.

1003
01:14:31,911 --> 01:14:33,979
I almost lost my burner too.

1004
01:14:34,514 --> 01:14:36,181
Şanslısın.

1005
01:14:36,216 --> 01:14:38,417
For making it to the last round.

1006
01:14:40,787 --> 01:14:42,688
There will be others.

1007
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:46,925
It's easy for you to say.

1008
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,994
You don't have a wife...

1009
01:14:49,362 --> 01:14:51,330
You have no children...

1010
01:14:51,364 --> 01:14:54,133
There's no one to mourn when you crash
.

1011
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:58,837
Evine git.

1012
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:01,573
Let's get some sleep.

1013
01:15:03,476 --> 01:15:06,11
Why did you take out my papers ﻿at the academy ?

1014
01:15:06,46 --> 01:15:08,480
Why did you get in my way?!

1015
01:15:09,849 --> 01:15:11,683
You were not ready.

1016
01:15:11,718 --> 01:15:13,352
What was I not ready for?

1017
01:15:14,354 --> 01:15:16,522
- To fly like you?
- No.

1018
01:15:16,556 --> 01:15:18,891
Don't forget the book.
To trust your instincts.

1019
01:15:18,925 --> 01:15:21,26
Not thinking, just doing.

1020
01:15:21,61 --> 01:15:22,694
If you start thinking above, you
will die.

1021
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:24,229
Believe me.

1022
01:15:24,564 --> 01:15:26,732
My father believed in you too.

1023
01:15:29,369 --> 01:15:31,470
I will not make the same mistake.

1024
01:15:36,943 --> 01:15:38,811
Maverick.

1025
01:15:49,122 --> 01:15:52,291
Ready, aim, fire!

1026
01:15:57,230 --> 01:16:01,33
Ready, aim, fire!

1027
01:16:11,778 --> 01:16:13,645
Ready, aim, fire!

1028
01:16:13,646 --> 01:16:15,948
Ready, aim, fire!

1029
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,885
It's impossible for me to understand ﻿what you're feeling right now .

1030
01:16:53,319 --> 01:16:56,255
Take some time off.
whatever you need.

1031
01:16:56,856 --> 01:16:59,491
Thank you sir
, but there is no time. Task...

1032
01:16:59,526 --> 01:17:02,127
I'm taking over the authority here.

1033
01:17:02,495 --> 01:17:03,996
Efendim?

1034
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:07,332
- We both know you don't want this job.
- Sir, they're not ready.

1035
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:08,934
It was your job to prepare them.

1036
01:17:09,02 --> 01:17:12,70
They must believe that ﻿this mission can succeed .

1037
01:17:12,172 --> 01:17:15,73
But you failed to do so.

1038
01:17:16,09 --> 01:17:18,644
- Sir...
- You're grounded, Captain.

1039
01:17:19,12 --> 01:17:20,779
permanently.

1040
01:17:24,384 --> 01:17:26,318
- Sir...
- That's it.

1041
01:17:43,603 --> 01:17:45,771
Duydum.

1042
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,141
Üzgünüm.

1043
01:17:49,509 --> 01:17:51,510
What will you do?

1044
01:17:51,911 --> 01:17:54,346
Ice is no more.

1045
01:17:56,115 --> 01:17:58,150
What other choice do I have?

1046
01:17:58,585 --> 01:18:00,819
You have to find a way back yourself
.

1047
01:18:01,621 --> 01:18:03,855
Penny...

1048
01:18:04,591 --> 01:18:06,558
That's it from me.

1049
01:18:07,827 --> 01:18:09,628
This is over.

1050
01:18:09,662 --> 01:18:13,165
Pete, even if
you lost your firefight in mid-air...

1051
01:18:13,433 --> 01:18:15,467
You keep fighting.

1052
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:17,636
You just don't give up.

1053
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:20,639
They are your pilots.

1054
01:18:21,07 --> 01:18:23,609
If anything happens to them...

1055
01:18:24,43 --> 01:18:26,511
... you can never forgive yourself.

1056
01:18:29,549 --> 01:18:32,17
I don't know what to do.

1057
01:18:36,55 --> 01:18:38,56
But you will find a way.

1058
01:18:39,993 --> 01:18:41,860
I know you.

1059
01:18:43,29 --> 01:18:45,864
Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.

1060
01:18:45,932 --> 01:18:48,600
Your new mission parameters ﻿as of today .

1061
01:18:48,935 --> 01:18:51,203
Destination
time is now 4 minutes.

1062
01:18:51,504 --> 01:18:54,373
You will enter the valley level by
Reducing your speed.

1063
01:18:54,407 --> 01:18:57,09
You shall not exceed ﻿420 nautical miles .

1064
01:18:57,43 --> 01:18:59,711
Sir, don't we give their planes
time to spot us?

1065
01:18:59,746 --> 01:19:02,948
You have a chance
to get off the plane, Lieutenant.

1066
01:19:02,982 --> 01:19:05,784
What are your chances of surviving ﻿hitting the mountain vertically ?

1067
01:19:05,852 --> 01:19:08,687
You will be attacking ﻿the target from higher altitude.

1068
01:19:08,721 --> 01:19:10,188
It's on the north wall.

1069
01:19:10,189 --> 01:19:12,57
Keeping your laser on target
will be more difficult...

1070
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:14,159
...but you will avoid ﻿the steep climb .

1071
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:17,95
And then the missiles
will turn us to dust.

1072
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:23,268
Who is this?

1073
01:19:24,537 --> 01:19:26,438
From Maverick to Field Control.

1074
01:19:26,806 --> 01:19:29,775
I'm entering the Alpha Point.
I want green zone approval.

1075
01:19:29,842 --> 01:19:32,477
Maverick, this is Field Control...

1076
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:35,180
Green zone confirmed but...

1077
01:19:35,214 --> 01:19:37,249
I don't see your name on the program
, sir.

1078
01:19:37,317 --> 01:19:39,418
It's not too late though.

1079
01:19:39,686 --> 01:19:41,19
Güzel.

1080
01:19:41,487 --> 01:19:44,456
Arrival time at new destination
2 minutes 15 seconds.

1081
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:46,391
2.15 mi? This is impossible.

1082
01:19:46,626 --> 01:19:49,294
I'm getting close to the first point.
Maverick is on its way.

1083
01:20:28,935 --> 01:20:30,836
Hassiktir.

1084
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:32,471
Hadi!

1085
01:21:26,492 --> 01:21:29,728
Tırmanıyorum. 3, 2, 1.

1086
01:21:56,189 --> 01:21:58,56
Bombs are on their way.

1087
01:22:14,574 --> 01:22:16,808
Tam 12'den! Hassiktir!

1088
01:22:18,177 --> 01:22:19,911
Evet.

1089
01:22:22,548 --> 01:22:24,249
Woe to your mother.

1090
01:22:36,462 --> 01:22:39,197
You put me in a difficult position
, Captain.

1091
01:22:39,565 --> 01:22:43,535
On the one hand, you showed that this mission can be
flown.

1092
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:45,971
Maybe the
only way to get out alive.

1093
01:22:47,06 --> 01:22:49,140
On the other hand...

1094
01:22:49,308 --> 01:22:52,177
...by smuggling a multimillion-dollar military
property and never again...

1095
01:22:52,211 --> 01:22:55,113
...
you did it by using it in a way that it can't take off.

1096
01:22:56,82 --> 01:22:58,984
Iceman is no longer
here to protect you.

1097
01:22:59,318 --> 01:23:01,186
It's up to me to take you to
court-martial and...

1098
01:23:01,187 --> 01:23:03,788
... have everything needed to get ﻿kicked out of the army .

1099
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:06,558
What do you think I should do?

1100
01:23:06,926 --> 01:23:10,529
Should I risk the lives of my pilots, and perhaps the
chances of success of this mission...

1101
01:23:11,531 --> 01:23:13,398
...or else...

1102
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:16,167
... as the leader of the faculty...

1103
01:23:16,636 --> 01:23:19,170
...and risk my career
?

1104
01:23:21,974 --> 01:23:25,43
- Sir...
- I think the Admiral didn't want an answer to his question.

1105
01:23:25,77 --> 01:23:27,178
Anladım.

1106
01:25:07,179 --> 01:25:09,47
Talk to me, Goose.

1107
01:25:12,184 --> 01:25:13,885
Komutan Mitchell.

1108
01:25:20,426 --> 01:25:22,761
You are where you belong.

1109
01:25:27,233 --> 01:25:29,367
make us proud.

1110
01:25:54,727 --> 01:25:57,195
It was an honor to fly with you.

1111
01:25:57,663 --> 01:26:01,299
Each of you
represents the best of the best.

1112
01:26:02,334 --> 01:26:05,36
This is a very special mission.

1113
01:26:05,738 --> 01:26:09,174
My choices are only
reflections of that.

1114
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:11,376
First Foxtrot team members.

1115
01:26:12,445 --> 01:26:14,579
Payback ve Fanboy.

1116
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:16,915
Phoenix ve Bob.

1117
01:26:20,519 --> 01:26:22,387
And your fire.

1118
01:26:27,159 --> 01:26:28,993
Rooster.

1119
01:26:32,498 --> 01:26:35,867
The rest of you are
in support roles on board...

1120
01:26:35,901 --> 01:26:38,169
... you will continue to stay.

1121
01:26:38,537 --> 01:26:40,338
Dağılabilirsiniz.

1122
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:50,715
Your target is a threat that needs ﻿immediate attention .

1123
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:55,553
It's a secret
uranium enrichment plant out of surveillance.

1124
01:26:56,589 --> 01:27:00,91
In an underground bunker.
Between these two mountains.

1125
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:07,398
There are 5th class warplanes ﻿at a nearby airport in the region .

1126
01:27:07,533 --> 01:27:09,768
After ﻿you take off and cross the border ...

1127
01:27:09,835 --> 01:27:13,71
...from the USS Ladygulf to the enemy
's airfield here...

1128
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:15,907
... synchronized Tomahawk
missiles will be fired.

1129
01:27:17,209 --> 01:27:20,44
This will put their tracks
out of play.

1130
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:24,215
But you'll have to deal with
planes that have already taken off.

1131
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:28,119
As soon as those missiles land
at the airport, they'll know you've arrived.

1132
01:27:28,587 --> 01:27:33,324
Your arrival time at the destination
will be 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

1133
01:27:34,193 --> 01:27:39,230
If it takes longer than that, you'll be on the radar of hijacked planes by the ﻿Tomahawks .

1134
01:27:42,568 --> 01:27:45,36
You were trained for this.

1135
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:48,940
Good luck back home.

1136
01:28:02,955 --> 01:28:05,423
Show your days.

1137
01:28:17,436 --> 01:28:20,471
Efendim!

1138
01:28:22,441 --> 01:28:24,375
Ben...

1139
01:28:26,178 --> 01:28:29,180
- I meant...
- All personnel take their seats.

1140
01:28:29,582 --> 01:28:34,986
All personnel take
their places for departure.

1141
01:28:37,122 --> 01:28:38,756
Konuşuruz.

1142
01:28:39,758 --> 01:28:41,793
Döndüğümüzde.

1143
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:49,701
Hey, Bradley? Bradley!

1144
01:28:50,35 --> 01:28:51,569
Hey...

1145
01:28:54,773 --> 01:28:56,908
You can do this.

1146
01:29:04,216 --> 01:29:05,984
Maverick.

1147
01:29:08,53 --> 01:29:09,287
Maverick?

1148
01:29:10,723 --> 01:29:12,624
Hey, are you with me?

1149
01:29:14,26 --> 01:29:15,927
Don't throw that look, man.

1150
01:29:18,597 --> 01:29:21,132
I only have this look.

1151
01:29:24,737 --> 01:29:26,504
Thank you.

1152
01:29:27,573 --> 01:29:30,41
If we don't see each other again...

1153
01:29:30,75 --> 01:29:32,10
Thank you.

1154
01:29:38,951 --> 01:29:41,286
It was my honor, Captain.

1155
01:30:13,519 --> 01:30:16,821
Dagger-1. Ready for takeoff
and standby.

1156
01:30:16,855 --> 01:30:19,57
Dagger-Reinforcement pending.

1157
01:30:19,58 --> 01:30:21,59
Dagger-4 is ready to take off.

1158
01:30:21,93 --> 01:30:22,927
Dagger-3 is ready to take off.

1159
01:30:22,962 --> 01:30:25,396
Dagger-2 is ready to take off.

1160
01:30:25,731 --> 01:30:28,666
Reinforcement drone in the air.
The assault team is ready.

1161
01:30:28,968 --> 01:30:31,302
We are waiting for orders.

1162
01:30:31,337 --> 01:30:33,37
Gönderin.

1163
01:30:52,491 --> 01:30:54,359
Dagger-2 in the air.

1164
01:30:54,793 --> 01:30:57,95
Dagger-3 in the air.

1165
01:30:57,262 --> 01:30:59,330
Dagger-4 in the air.

1166
01:31:09,808 --> 01:31:10,475
Komanchi, Dagger-1.
Standard control.

1167
01:31:10,476 --> 01:31:12,610
Komanchi, Dagger-1.

1168
01:31:14,146 --> 01:31:15,213
Komanchi 1-1, done.

1169
01:31:15,314 --> 01:31:17,482
The image is clean. I recommend Dagger
go ahead.

1170
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:20,385
Got it. We're going under the radar
.

1171
01:31:39,38 --> 01:31:40,838
Dagger is under the radar right now.

1172
01:31:40,839 --> 01:31:43,307
I switch to snapshot.

1173
01:31:50,582 --> 01:31:53,17
Here we are. forward
enemy territory.

1174
01:31:53,85 --> 01:31:54,585
60 seconds to the limit.

1175
01:31:54,686 --> 01:31:56,421
Komanchi, Dagger-1. Image?

1176
01:31:56,555 --> 01:31:59,557
Komanchi, the image is
clear. The decision is yours.

1177
01:31:59,825 --> 01:32:01,292
Anlaşıldı.

1178
01:32:08,534 --> 01:32:10,435
Dagger, attack.

1179
01:32:15,40 --> 01:32:17,08
Tomahawks took off.

1180
01:32:17,42 --> 01:32:19,210
There is no turning back anymore.

1181
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:26,818
Daggers, let's move on to ﻿offensive formation .

1182
01:32:34,993 --> 01:32:37,695
The Daggers have been replaced.
We are moving towards the goal^

1183
01:32:37,729 --> 01:32:39,197
It starts at 2 minutes 30 seconds.

1184
01:32:39,298 --> 01:32:42,66
3, 2, 1... started.

1185
01:32:42,334 --> 01:32:43,935
- 2 okay.
- 3 OK.

1186
01:32:44,02 --> 01:32:45,536
4 ok.

1187
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:51,275
Giriyoruz.

1188
01:33:06,58 --> 01:33:08,226
There are heat-seeking missiles ahead.

1189
01:33:12,531 --> 01:33:14,365
They don't work under the radar
, Mav.

1190
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:16,367
Let's tie our rope to the solid
stake.

1191
01:33:19,204 --> 01:33:21,405
More missiles on the hill.

1192
01:33:23,942 --> 01:33:25,743
We have 2 minutes left to the target.

1193
01:33:25,777 --> 01:33:27,645
Got it. Time
is running out, Rooster.

1194
01:33:27,646 --> 01:33:28,646
Hızlanmalıyız.

1195
01:33:30,15 --> 01:33:33,151
30 seconds for Tomahawks to land on the ﻿enemy airfield .

1196
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,461
Dagger, Komanchi. We're getting two
enemy signals.

1197
01:33:43,529 --> 01:33:44,795
It's right in front of us. Two contacts.

1198
01:33:44,897 --> 01:33:46,330
Where did these come from?

1199
01:33:46,398 --> 01:33:48,766
Field patrol?

1200
01:33:52,671 --> 01:33:54,172
Komanchi, which way are they going?

1201
01:33:54,206 --> 01:33:55,640
Rotaları 0-9-0-5.

1202
01:33:55,707 --> 01:33:57,675
- They're headed southwest.
- They're moving away from us.

1203
01:33:57,676 --> 01:33:58,876
They don't know we are here.

1204
01:33:58,911 --> 01:34:03,281
As those Tomahawks land at the airport,
enemy planes will go to cover the target.

1205
01:34:03,348 --> 01:34:05,116
We must be there before they arrive
.

1206
01:34:05,150 --> 01:34:06,851
I increase the speed.

1207
01:34:07,186 --> 01:34:09,153
We take care of you,
Mav. Do not wait for me.

1208
01:34:15,494 --> 01:34:18,462
Sir, Dagger
3 and 4 can't keep up.

1209
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:20,565
Arrival time at destination,
1 minute 20 seconds.

1210
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,635
3, 2...

1211
01:34:28,106 --> 01:34:29,307
Düştüler!

1212
01:34:29,408 --> 01:34:31,742
The enemy airbase was destroyed.

1213
01:34:31,777 --> 01:34:33,711
They're all coming now.

1214
01:34:36,715 --> 01:34:39,116
Enemies
change direction towards the target.

1215
01:34:39,151 --> 01:34:40,718
Rooster, where are you

1216
01:34:41,587 --> 01:34:44,789
Come on, Rooster! We
have to make up for the time while we can!

1217
01:34:44,856 --> 01:34:46,891
You heard the man.

1218
01:34:53,665 --> 01:34:55,533
Affedersin, Phoenix.

1219
01:35:05,277 --> 01:35:07,278
Sir, the enemies
are 2 minutes from the target.

1220
01:35:07,312 --> 01:35:09,280
Daggers
1 minute away from target.

1221
01:35:09,314 --> 01:35:11,482
Come on, Rooster. We will lose.

1222
01:35:13,785 --> 01:35:16,654
Guys, we're lagging behind!
We really need to speed up!

1223
01:35:16,688 --> 01:35:18,756
If we don't accelerate now
, those enemy planes...

1224
01:35:18,757 --> 01:35:21,25
... it will be close ﻿when we reach the destination !

1225
01:35:22,894 --> 01:35:24,895
Talk to me, dad.

1226
01:35:25,764 --> 01:35:28,232
Come on kid,
you can do it. Thinking!

1227
01:35:28,467 --> 01:35:29,900
Sadece yap!

1228
01:35:32,137 --> 01:35:33,604
Evet!

1229
01:35:37,175 --> 01:35:39,243
Looks like Rooster
has decided to join us.

1230
01:35:39,311 --> 01:35:40,544
That's it, son. That's it!

1231
01:35:40,646 --> 01:35:42,446
All right, we're leaving.

1232
01:35:45,984 --> 01:35:47,752
Rooster, be slow!

1233
01:35:48,20 --> 01:35:50,521
Sir, Dagger-2 is
catching up.

1234
01:35:51,456 --> 01:35:53,324
Hit your target and go home.

1235
01:35:58,96 --> 01:36:00,298
30 seconds to target.
Prepare your laser.

1236
01:36:00,365 --> 01:36:04,535
1-6-8-8 confirmation code,
laser scanning completed.

1237
01:36:04,569 --> 01:36:06,137
The lasers are ready!

1238
01:36:07,572 --> 01:36:09,106
Watch out for the heads.

1239
01:36:10,275 --> 01:36:11,742
Hassiktir be!

1240
01:36:11,777 --> 01:36:14,278
- Payback, are you with me?
- I'm right behind you.

1241
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,81
Phoenix, prepare to climb.

1242
01:36:17,115 --> 01:36:18,482
Dagger-3 took its position.

1243
01:36:19,184 --> 01:36:22,53
Tırmanmaya 3, 2, 1...

1244
01:36:36,802 --> 01:36:38,369
Hassiktir...

1245
01:36:49,247 --> 01:36:51,115
Aim the laser, Bob.

1246
01:36:51,149 --> 01:36:52,883
Deniyorum...

1247
01:36:52,951 --> 01:36:55,553
- Stand by!
- Come on Bob, come on!

1248
01:36:55,587 --> 01:36:56,854
Bekleyin

1249
01:36:57,289 --> 01:36:58,356
Thank you! Send!

1250
01:36:58,490 --> 01:37:00,758
Target detected. Bombs are on their way.

1251
01:37:20,779 --> 01:37:22,380
We hit him, Mav!

1252
01:37:22,414 --> 01:37:24,48
fuck it! Fuck!

1253
01:37:24,82 --> 01:37:26,584
The first miracle happened.

1254
01:37:26,818 --> 01:37:28,719
Dagger-2, status report.

1255
01:37:28,754 --> 01:37:30,654
I'm about to arrive, Mav. I came!

1256
01:37:32,791 --> 01:37:34,725
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1257
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:37,27
Rooster, I can't
lock the laser!

1258
01:37:37,95 --> 01:37:39,163
Siktir! From, from, from!

1259
01:37:39,164 --> 01:37:40,531
Come on, guys!
We're running out of time!

1260
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,635
I got it! I caught!

1261
01:37:47,372 --> 01:37:48,873
Hassiktir!

1262
01:37:52,978 --> 01:37:56,80
- Come on, Fanboy. Get it done!
- No time. I'm going to shoot blind.

1263
01:37:56,114 --> 01:37:58,15
- Rooster, I'm on it. Wait!
- There's no time left.

1264
01:37:58,16 --> 01:38:00,50
Bombs are on the way! bombs on the way

1265
01:38:13,298 --> 01:38:14,498
It's 12! It's 12!

1266
01:38:18,603 --> 01:38:20,137
Second miracle.

1267
01:38:20,205 --> 01:38:21,872
The corner of the coffin remained.

1268
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:24,775
We're not done yet.

1269
01:38:26,144 --> 01:38:27,812
Here it begins.

1270
01:38:29,915 --> 01:38:32,716
Missiles took off!
Phohenix, right behind you!

1271
01:38:32,751 --> 01:38:34,485
Got it, I'm back!

1272
01:38:34,553 --> 01:38:36,253
Another one is coming!

1273
01:38:36,855 --> 01:38:38,589
Dagger-1, on the defensive!

1274
01:38:44,663 --> 01:38:46,263
Rooster, status report?

1275
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:55,739
oh my god.

1276
01:38:57,375 --> 01:38:59,243
Missiles took off!
Missiles took off!

1277
01:38:59,544 --> 01:39:01,579
Right wing, Payback! Right wing!

1278
01:39:01,613 --> 01:39:02,780
Dönüyorum!

1279
01:39:02,848 --> 01:39:04,715
oh my god! Coming!

1280
01:39:05,450 --> 01:39:07,384
How do we get rid of them?!

1281
01:39:08,453 --> 01:39:10,154
I'm taking countermeasures!

1282
01:39:12,757 --> 01:39:14,525
Themes were.

1283
01:39:15,594 --> 01:39:17,595
Dagger-1 is descending.

1284
01:39:18,330 --> 01:39:21,98
- Talk, Bob!
- Turn, Phoenix! Frost!

1285
01:39:21,333 --> 01:39:23,234
in the direction of 9! 9!

1286
01:39:23,535 --> 01:39:25,736
Rooster, there are two more ﻿behind you!

1287
01:39:25,971 --> 01:39:27,638
Dagger-2 on the defensive!

1288
01:39:31,843 --> 01:39:33,110
Payback, put your nose down!

1289
01:39:33,178 --> 01:39:35,379
Dagger-4 to 3,
use your deflectors!

1290
01:39:35,447 --> 01:39:36,947
- Talk, Bob!
- It's bad!

1291
01:39:36,982 --> 01:39:39,416
- It's coming again!
- We're busy here!

1292
01:39:46,57 --> 01:39:48,25
Dagger-2 on the defensive!

1293
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,561
Fuck, I'm out of deflectors!

1294
01:39:50,629 --> 01:39:52,162
Rooster, Sallan! Sallan!

1295
01:39:52,264 --> 01:39:54,865
I can't escape!
They're after me, they're after me!

1296
01:40:05,443 --> 01:40:06,944
No! No!

1297
01:40:08,647 --> 01:40:10,114
Dagger-1 has been hit!

1298
01:40:10,215 --> 01:40:12,216
I repeat, Dagger-1 has been hit!

1299
01:40:12,317 --> 01:40:13,651
Maverick crashed.

1300
01:40:13,718 --> 01:40:16,487
Dagger-1, status
report? Status report?

1301
01:40:16,588 --> 01:40:19,323
Has anyone seen him?
Has anyone seen him?

1302
01:40:19,357 --> 01:40:21,292
- Dagger-1, answer!
- I didn't see a parachute.

1303
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:23,93
We need to go back.

1304
01:40:23,94 --> 01:40:24,728
Komanchi, the enemies are on their way.

1305
01:40:24,796 --> 01:40:27,498
They come straight to you. Dagger
is suggested to move south.

1306
01:40:28,33 --> 01:40:29,833
Enemies are heading south.

1307
01:40:33,204 --> 01:40:34,772
Call them aboard now.

1308
01:40:34,873 --> 01:40:37,741
All Daggers advance to ECP
. The ship is waiting for you.

1309
01:40:37,776 --> 01:40:40,477
- What about Maverick?
- Tell him there's nothing you can do for Maverick.

1310
01:40:40,478 --> 01:40:44,515
- Not in an F-18.
- Dagger-Reinforcement recovery mission requests confirmation.

1311
01:40:47,152 --> 01:40:48,786
Negative, Reinforcement.

1312
01:40:49,54 --> 01:40:51,689
- Start search and rescue.
- Negative. Not when the enemies are there.

1313
01:40:51,723 --> 01:40:54,925
- Sir, Maverick is still there...
- We're not going to lose anyone else today.

1314
01:40:57,128 --> 01:40:58,862
Call them home now.

1315
01:40:58,897 --> 01:41:01,165
Dagger, don't make contact.

1316
01:41:01,366 --> 01:41:03,601
I repeat, do not contact.

1317
01:41:03,602 --> 01:41:05,202
Dagger-2, we're going home.

1318
01:41:05,303 --> 01:41:07,738
come back. Turn back.

1319
01:41:07,772 --> 01:41:09,640
Rooster, those enemies are approaching.

1320
01:41:09,841 --> 01:41:11,642
We can't go back.

1321
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:13,444
Rooster.

1322
01:41:13,478 --> 01:41:15,212
He died.

1323
01:41:15,447 --> 01:41:17,715
Maverick is dead.

1324
01:42:54,814 --> 01:42:56,674
Dagger-2 was shot down.

1325
01:42:58,216 --> 01:42:59,950
Dagger-2 was shot down.

1326
01:43:00,919 --> 01:43:02,953
Dagger-2, come in.

1327
01:43:04,55 --> 01:43:06,123
Dagger-2, do you hear?

1328
01:43:06,491 --> 01:43:08,826
Dagger-2, answer!

1329
01:43:34,285 --> 01:43:36,253
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am good.

1330
01:43:36,321 --> 01:43:37,588
are you okay?

1331
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:40,290
What are you doing?!

1332
01:43:40,325 --> 01:43:41,558
What are you doing here?

1333
01:43:41,626 --> 01:43:43,894
- What am I doing?
- You shoot that missile too...

1334
01:43:43,962 --> 01:43:47,431
... did I eat it to get shot?
You should be on board right now!

1335
01:43:47,465 --> 01:43:50,601
- I saved your life!
- I saved your life.

1336
01:43:50,835 --> 01:43:52,503
That was the whole point.

1337
01:43:52,537 --> 01:43:54,471
What was on your mind?

1338
01:43:54,572 --> 01:43:56,540
You're the one who said don't think!

1339
01:44:12,991 --> 01:44:14,591
Neyse...

1340
01:44:15,894 --> 01:44:17,427
It's good to see you.

1341
01:44:19,164 --> 01:44:21,298
Seni of.

1342
01:44:24,969 --> 01:44:26,570
So what's the plan?

1343
01:44:37,282 --> 01:44:39,283
You cannot be serious.

1344
01:44:54,566 --> 01:44:56,667
You're goofing off, aren't you?

1345
01:44:57,602 --> 01:44:59,69
An F-14?

1346
01:44:59,137 --> 01:45:01,471
I had taken down three enemies ﻿on one of those things .

1347
01:45:01,573 --> 01:45:03,707
How do we know if ﻿that scrap can fly ?

1348
01:45:06,678 --> 01:45:08,745
Öğrenelim hadi.

1349
01:45:10,882 --> 01:45:12,282
Tamam.

1350
01:45:20,959 --> 01:45:23,26
- There are men ahead.
- Yes.

1351
01:45:24,62 --> 01:45:26,396
- Let's not draw attention.
- OK.

1352
01:45:27,465 --> 01:45:29,600
Let's start running. Run, come on!

1353
01:45:38,843 --> 01:45:41,678
rooster When he gives you
the signal...

1354
01:45:41,913 --> 01:45:44,715
.. when the needle reaches 120
, turn the lever.

1355
01:45:44,716 --> 01:45:48,518
When the engine starts, all the
pins and cables are removed.

1356
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,87
- Got it?
- Yes.

1357
01:45:52,357 --> 01:45:53,657
Evet!

1358
01:45:55,593 --> 01:45:57,694
Collect the ladder when you get up.

1359
01:46:05,436 --> 01:46:06,904
Tamam.

1360
01:46:07,272 --> 01:46:08,505
Vay be...

1361
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:10,941
It's been a long time, huh Mav?

1362
01:46:39,237 --> 01:46:41,104
oh my god...

1363
01:46:41,372 --> 01:46:42,873
This thing is very old.

1364
01:46:42,874 --> 01:46:44,574
Let's see.

1365
01:46:49,414 --> 01:46:51,381
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1366
01:47:09,334 --> 01:47:11,268
Even if the track isn't clean...

1367
01:47:11,769 --> 01:47:14,438
...how do we ventilate this museum scrap
?

1368
01:47:24,515 --> 01:47:26,483
Wings from here, Mav.

1369
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:34,424
Mav, it's a taxiway.

1370
01:47:34,459 --> 01:47:38,628
It's not the runway. You have a very narrow take-
off area, Mav.

1371
01:47:38,863 --> 01:47:40,530
You hold on tight.

1372
01:47:41,766 --> 01:47:43,433
Hassiktir be!

1373
01:47:47,972 --> 01:47:49,639
Hadi, hadi, hadi!

1374
01:47:49,674 --> 01:47:51,775
I know you, come on.

1375
01:47:54,245 --> 01:47:55,245
Mav?

1376
01:47:55,279 --> 01:47:57,481
Come on, some more!

1377
01:47:58,683 --> 01:48:01,51
- Blue!
- Here we go.

1378
01:48:02,153 --> 01:48:03,954
Hassiktir be...

1379
01:48:17,135 --> 01:48:20,337
Sir,
we're picking up signals from Rooster's GPS.

1380
01:48:20,605 --> 01:48:21,938
It doesn't look like a malfunction.

1381
01:48:22,06 --> 01:48:24,274
- Did you lose him?
- No, sir.

1382
01:48:24,642 --> 01:48:26,543
Supersonic right now.

1383
01:48:26,878 --> 01:48:28,712
Havada.

1384
01:48:29,113 --> 01:48:31,148
- What is it in?
- Sorry!

1385
01:48:31,482 --> 01:48:35,752
Information came from the tower that there was an F-14 ﻿heading towards our position .

1386
01:48:36,621 --> 01:48:38,188
This is impossible.

1387
01:48:38,222 --> 01:48:39,890
They can't.

1388
01:48:40,958 --> 01:48:42,626
Maverick.

1389
01:48:44,28 --> 01:48:46,930
All right, Rooster.
Contact the ship.

1390
01:48:46,931 --> 01:48:47,831
Uğraşıyorum.

1391
01:48:47,965 --> 01:48:50,500
No wireless. There is no radar.

1392
01:48:50,735 --> 01:48:51,935
Everything is dead here.

1393
01:48:52,03 --> 01:48:53,703
What will I do? Tell me.

1394
01:48:53,771 --> 01:48:56,740
Radio first. do something...

1395
01:48:56,908 --> 01:48:58,975
UHF-2... circuit breaker.

1396
01:48:59,10 --> 01:49:00,177
Onu dene.

1397
01:49:00,244 --> 01:49:03,213
Lots of weird circuits
here. Any other details?

1398
01:49:03,281 --> 01:49:05,449
I don't know. It was your father
's department.

1399
01:49:05,483 --> 01:49:07,117
I solve it.

1400
01:49:09,787 --> 01:49:12,55
Mav, enemy aircraft below us.

1401
01:49:17,328 --> 01:49:18,929
what to do

1402
01:49:19,263 --> 01:49:21,731
OK, listen. act calm.

1403
01:49:21,766 --> 01:49:24,34
If they knew who we are , we'd
be dead already.

1404
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:28,38
Here they come.

1405
01:49:28,339 --> 01:49:29,372
Planın ne?

1406
01:49:29,474 --> 01:49:31,441
Let's put on our masks.

1407
01:49:32,43 --> 01:49:34,711
Remember, we're on the same team.

1408
01:49:37,81 --> 01:49:39,82
Wave and smile.

1409
01:49:39,417 --> 01:49:41,985
Wave and smile.

1410
01:49:48,593 --> 01:49:50,393
What is this signal? What is he saying?

1411
01:49:50,461 --> 01:49:52,929
I don't know at all. I don't know what
he says.

1412
01:49:53,564 --> 01:49:55,232
What about this? Any idea?

1413
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:57,334
No, I've never seen that either.

1414
01:50:00,438 --> 01:50:02,205
Hassiktir.

1415
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,908
They're trying to envelop us.

1416
01:50:05,877 --> 01:50:06,943
OK, listen.

1417
01:50:07,11 --> 01:50:09,479
When I tell you,
keep the rings on your head.

1418
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:11,648
They're the launch rope.

1419
01:50:12,49 --> 01:50:14,784
Mav, can we ﻿beat these guys

1420
01:50:15,86 --> 01:50:17,87
With loads of guns and missiles.

1421
01:50:21,759 --> 01:50:23,660
Then there will be a dogfight.

1422
01:50:24,95 --> 01:50:27,564
In an F-14? Against 5th
generation warplanes?

1423
01:50:28,432 --> 01:50:30,934
It's not on the plane, it's on the pilot.

1424
01:50:32,36 --> 01:50:34,304
If it wasn't for me, you'd be after them.

1425
01:50:34,672 --> 01:50:36,740
But you are here.

1426
01:50:37,41 --> 01:50:39,42
Hadi, Mav.

1427
01:50:39,944 --> 01:50:41,578
Düşünme.

1428
01:50:41,946 --> 01:50:43,914
Sadece yap.

1429
01:50:58,663 --> 01:51:00,797
If you see a launch missile, tell me!

1430
01:51:05,369 --> 01:51:07,204
- The missile has taken off! The missile took off!
- Hold tight!

1431
01:51:10,374 --> 01:51:12,542
Damn it, man! Someone's gone!

1432
01:51:17,848 --> 01:51:19,282
Another one is coming!

1433
01:51:22,553 --> 01:51:24,387
Rooster, deflectors!
Come on come on come on!

1434
01:51:27,391 --> 01:51:29,392
Get ready to cut gas!

1435
01:51:31,562 --> 01:51:33,96
Dönüyoruz!

1436
01:51:37,134 --> 01:51:39,569
- Now it's my turn.
- On target, man! On target!

1437
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:41,271
I'm shooting!

1438
01:51:47,78 --> 01:51:48,812
What was that?

1439
01:51:49,80 --> 01:51:51,548
It's silly, what was that?

1440
01:51:52,817 --> 01:51:54,985
Hold tight! We will descend.

1441
01:51:55,19 --> 01:51:57,621
Rough terrain
will confuse the targeting system.

1442
01:51:59,423 --> 01:52:01,91
Here it comes.

1443
01:52:13,137 --> 01:52:15,38
Speak, Rooster. Where?

1444
01:52:15,473 --> 01:52:17,173
It's still after us.

1445
01:52:23,781 --> 01:52:25,815
The fire is getting ready to open!

1446
01:52:25,850 --> 01:52:27,150
damn it!

1447
01:52:31,122 --> 01:52:33,156
Come on, man!
Be a hero!

1448
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:34,557
Hold tight!

1449
01:52:43,501 --> 01:52:45,568
Hassiktir!

1450
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:54,244
On target! I open fire.

1451
01:52:58,382 --> 01:52:59,683
damn it!

1452
01:53:01,52 --> 01:53:03,253
Missiles are gone. I'm on the gun.

1453
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,94
Hadi, Mav. Hadi!

1454
01:53:13,30 --> 01:53:15,31
- You can, man!
- Once again.

1455
01:53:19,570 --> 01:53:21,538
- One last chance.
- You can do it.

1456
01:53:22,506 --> 01:53:24,40
Hadi, Maverick.

1457
01:53:33,851 --> 01:53:35,785
Yes! We're done!

1458
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:47,630
Mav, I turned on the radio.

1459
01:53:47,698 --> 01:53:50,700
- Great. Communicate with the ship.
- Understood.

1460
01:53:52,803 --> 01:53:54,571
oh my god.

1461
01:53:55,906 --> 01:53:57,907
Where is this man?

1462
01:53:58,909 --> 01:54:00,710
right under our noses.

1463
01:54:03,981 --> 01:54:05,648
Damn, we're out of ammo.

1464
01:54:07,151 --> 01:54:09,652
The missile took off!
Rooster, deflectors!

1465
01:54:12,189 --> 01:54:13,957
This was so close!

1466
01:54:16,694 --> 01:54:18,628
We're out of deflectors, Mav.

1467
01:54:22,66 --> 01:54:24,267
Shit, he's targeting us!

1468
01:54:28,739 --> 01:54:30,874
This has not been good!

1469
01:54:38,749 --> 01:54:40,950
- Mitchell, we're gonna get shot!
- No no no!

1470
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:47,590
We can't take it anymore!

1471
01:54:47,691 --> 01:54:49,726
We ca n't escape ﻿this man . We have to throw it.

1472
01:54:49,794 --> 01:54:51,60
- What?
- We need altitude.

1473
01:54:51,128 --> 01:54:53,163
Pull the launch handle ﻿as soon as I tell you .

1474
01:54:53,197 --> 01:54:55,231
- Mav, what...?
- Rooster, you're leaving.

1475
01:54:58,469 --> 01:55:00,503
Throw, throw, throw!

1476
01:55:00,771 --> 01:55:03,339
Rooster, pull the lever! Throw it!

1477
01:55:03,574 --> 01:55:05,241
It doesn't work!

1478
01:55:15,186 --> 01:55:17,20
Mav!

1479
01:55:18,989 --> 01:55:20,723
Üzgünüm.

1480
01:55:21,859 --> 01:55:23,993
Sorry, kid.

1481
01:55:36,40 --> 01:55:38,141
No need to stand up
, ladies and gentlemen.

1482
01:55:38,175 --> 01:55:40,310
Your savior is speaking.

1483
01:55:40,578 --> 01:55:44,614
Please fasten your seat belts
and follow me home.

1484
01:55:45,716 --> 01:55:47,817
And prepare to land.

1485
01:55:50,387 --> 01:55:52,856
Hey, Hangman. You look good.

1486
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:54,757
İyiyim, Rooster.

1487
01:55:54,792 --> 01:55:56,459
I am very good.

1488
01:55:57,795 --> 01:55:59,996
See you on board.

1489
01:56:21,51 --> 01:56:24,988
Maverick goes against the wind.
It has no front landing gear and no brakes.

1490
01:56:25,22 --> 01:56:26,523
Pull the rope for a hard stop.

1491
01:56:26,557 --> 01:56:29,759
All personnel on deck!

1492
01:56:29,793 --> 01:56:31,594
Come on, walk!

1493
01:56:53,651 --> 01:56:55,318
Please don't tell me we lost ﻿an engine .

1494
01:56:55,386 --> 01:56:57,186
OK, I won't tell you that.

1495
01:56:57,254 --> 01:56:58,454
Tamam.

1496
01:56:58,455 --> 01:56:59,22
Tamam.

1497
01:57:22,212 --> 01:57:24,647
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1498
01:57:24,682 --> 01:57:26,249
İyiyim.

1499
01:58:10,628 --> 01:58:13,863
- You finally landed a plane in battle.
- That's two.

1500
01:58:14,231 --> 01:58:15,665
Maverick downloaded five.

1501
01:58:15,699 --> 01:58:17,800
That makes it second.

1502
01:58:35,386 --> 01:58:38,54
Yüzbaşı Mitchell?

1503
01:58:44,428 --> 01:58:46,162
Efendim?

1504
01:58:53,237 --> 01:58:55,405
Thank you for ﻿saving my life .

1505
01:58:56,373 --> 01:58:58,808
My father would do the same.

1506
01:59:37,281 --> 01:59:39,82
Hey, Mav.

1507
01:59:39,149 --> 01:59:40,717
Jimmy.

1508
01:59:41,18 --> 01:59:43,152
Acaba...

1509
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,254
Is Penny around?

1510
01:59:45,289 --> 01:59:48,491
They went on a boat trip ﻿with Emilia .

1511
01:59:50,928 --> 01:59:52,829
Did he say when he'll be back?

1512
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:55,198
No, he didn't.
