1
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,463
On March 3, 1969, the US Navy
established a school for its best pilots, which accounted for 1% of the total.

2
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,433
Its purpose is to teach the art of dogfighting, air combat, and...

3
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:39,438
...to make men and women the best
fighter pilots.

4
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,376
They have succeeded. Today the Navy
calls it Fighter Weapons School.

5
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:44,510
Aviators say:

6
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:48,178
TOP GUN

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,910
Ojave Desert, California

8
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,339
Forbidden Zone
Authorization to Use Deadly Force

9
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,356
Hey.

10
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,128
what happened?

11
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,331
Ne var?

12
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,968
We got a withdrawal order.
They are closing the program.

13
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,071
They say we're behind

14
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,207
In the deal we made ﻿for the Mark 10 .

15
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,409
Two more months until Mark 10.

16
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,711
And these tests are for the Mark 9.

17
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,547
That wasn't good enough.

18
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,616
- Who says?
- Admiral Cane.

19
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,519
Drone fighter.

20
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,855
He wants our budget transferred to his drone
program.

21
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,091
He's coming here to terminate the ﻿Program himself .

22
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,208
What can we do?

23
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,713
Does he want Mark 10?

24
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,216
Let's give him the Mark 10.

25
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,935
Let me inform you again.
The deal is for the Mark-10.

26
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,504
Not 10.1, not 10.2.

27
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,906
Mark-10.

28
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,308
This keeps the program alive.

29
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,813
I don't like that look, man.

30
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,083
I only have this view.

31
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,361
Control, this is Dark
Star. What are the values?

32
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,296
He can hear the control sound just fine
. And you?

33
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,032
Pretty clear. Let's move on to the departure
procedure.

34
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm ready for ATU, sir.

35
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,169
Rear left engine running.

36
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,373
Rear right engine is running.

37
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,975
Acceleration confirmation?

38
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,445
We are ready to accelerate.

39
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,550
Dark Star's main
engines are ready for takeoff.

40
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,319
Dark Star's engines are active.

41
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,322
It's on track 2.
Its course is 2-1-0-1-0.

42
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,091
Engine temperature
seems fine. Check confirmed.

43
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,061
Dark Star is at 95% power
and pressure looks good.

44
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,229
Check confirmed.

45
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,833
From Dark Star to Tower.
We're ready to take off and we're asking permission.

46
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,670
Dark Star, the runway is yours.

47
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,272
Are you Admiral Chester Cain?

48
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,875
Maverick, Cain has
just entered the base.

49
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,544
It's not too
late to stop, man.

50
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,747
You
know what will happen to you if you keep going.

51
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,919
I know what will happen
to you if I don't.

52
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,823
Dark Star is ready to take off.

53
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,462
Everyone, prepare to take off.

54
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,396
Let's start with the engines.

55
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,198
- The engines are ready.
- Thermal ready.

56
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,534
- Fuel is ready.
- Mid engine ready.

57
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,471
- Control units are ready.
- Dark Star, you've received clearance.

58
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,306
All right, honey.

59
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,809
One last ride.

60
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,033
Dark Star,
you're allowed to go above 600 feet.

61
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,701
Ascend 3.5 miles.

62
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,003
I'm leaving 600 feet.

63
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,339
I'm climbing 3.5 miles.

64
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,212
Amiral...

65
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,682
- Just in time, sir.
- Your time is up.

66
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,184
Do you have an explanation?

67
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,986
I'm switching to the Seram jet.

68
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,602
- Mav wants Admiral Cain...
- He commands.

69
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,638
He orders... that we take it down.

70
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,808
Alfa... Green...

71
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,410
Forward... value...

72
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,946
And mark... target...

73
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,981
That 's the problem we're having with communication
, sir.

74
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,118
Sometimes parasites can occur.
We are still trying to solve it.

75
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,820
Has anyone offered you coffee?

76
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,055
Pekala.

77
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,498
Currently on Mark-7. It's pushing 8.

78
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,267
- Flight data?
- Receiving. Data is in good condition.

79
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,875
The temperature is rising.
Values ​​are still stable.

80
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,477
We will not have any problems.

81
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,714
Mark-8.8.

82
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,716
8.9.

83
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,251
Locked to 9.0.

84
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,720
He is the fastest man alive.

85
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,241
Talk to me, Goose.

86
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,611
Mark 9.1.

87
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,255
Mark 9.3.

88
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,758
Mark 9.4.

89
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,428
Approaching high hypersonic
velocity.

90
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,209
Windshield heat shield.

91
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,786
The surface temperature is rising.

92
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,160
Come on, honey. A little more.

93
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,496
a little more.

94
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,167
Hadi!

95
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,808
Hadi!

96
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,948
- Mark 10!
- Yes!

97
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,552
Take your budget cut!!

98
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,255
Efendim.

99
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,168
Don't do it. Do not do this...

100
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,036
Sadece...

101
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,007
... a little push...

102
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,779
Hassiktir be...

103
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,491
It takes balls to do this.

104
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,460
You have to give your due.

105
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,330
PRESS TO RESET MAIN ALARM

106
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,832
Hassiktir...

107
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,472
Maverick?

108
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,408
Maverick?

109
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,626
Thank you.

110
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,728
Neredeyim ben?

111
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,264
İrlanda.

112
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,979
Maverick.

113
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,816
More than 30 years of service.

114
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,586
War medals. Notifications...

115
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:19,424
The only man to have shot down 3 enemy
planes in the last 40 years.

116
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:25,664
Outstanding effort.

117
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,633
But you don't get promoted.

118
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,369
You are not retiring.

119
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,271
And no matter how hard you try
, you refuse to die.

120
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,608
You should at least
be a two-star admiral by now.

121
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,543
Or a senator.

122
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,645
But here you are.

123
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,281
Yüzbaşı.

124
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,417
Why is that?

125
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,819
That's one of life's mysteries
, sir.

126
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,189
This is not a joke.
I asked you a question.

127
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,260
I'm where I belong, sir.

128
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,463
The Navy
doesn't see it that way.

129
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,766
Not anymore.

130
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:05,170
Those planes you're testing
, Captain...

131
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,274
Someday
soon there will be no need for pilots at all.

132
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,311
To the pilots who need to ﻿sleep, eat, pee.

133
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,916
To the pilots who disobeyed orders.

134
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:22,020
All you did was buy those guys out there
some time.

135
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,124
But the future is on its way.

136
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,193
And you are not in it.

137
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,631
Best
to send these guys from base.

138
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,833
take to headquarters.

139
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,969
Say goodbye to them ﻿while you pack your things .

140
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,008
I want them on their way to Northern Ireland in an hour
.

141
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,447
To Northern Ireland, sir?

142
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,882
A call came ﻿at the perfect time .

143
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:55,086
Just when I came here
to punish you forever.

144
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,857
I don't feel comfortable saying that.

145
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:04,362
But I can say that he owes ﻿his guardian angel .

146
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,967
You've been recalled to Top Gun.

147
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,640
- Sir?
- You can go, Captain.

148
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,715
Penultimate, none, Maverick.

149
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,418
Your species is doomed to extinction.

150
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,656
It may be so, sir.

151
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,659
But not today.

152
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:47,105
San Diego, Califomia
Fightertown U.S.A

153
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,835
Pacific Fleet
Naval Air Force

154
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:38,957
Tom "Iceman" Kazansky
, Commander of the Pacific Fleet

155
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,394
Yüzbaşı Pete
"Maverick" Mitchell.

156
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,330
Your fame precedes you.

157
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,499
Thank you, sir.

158
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,168
It wasn't a compliment.

159
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,705
Ben Amiral Beau
Simpson. Hava patronuyum.

160
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,106
Yardımcım Solomon Bates.

161
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,708
Warlock, sir?

162
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,210
I have to say I didn't expect to be called back
.

163
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,680
These are called "orders"
, Maverick.

164
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,848
You two have something in common.

165
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,551
The "Cyclone" next to me
was best-in-class in 1988.

166
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,421
I actually
finished second, sir.

167
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,656
I just wanted to meet expectations
.

168
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,562
Let's get to the goal.

169
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,900
An unauthorized uranium
enrichment plant.

170
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,502
It was built in violation ﻿of numerous NATO agreements .

171
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,404
The uranium produced there...

172
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,574
... poses a direct threat to ﻿our allies in the region .

173
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,044
The Pentagon has given us the task of forming an assault team to ﻿destroy it .

174
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,480
before it is ﻿fully operational .

175
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,684
The facility is located in an underground bunker ﻿behind this mountain .

176
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:44,689
GPS does not work in the valley and is surrounded by
heat-seeking missiles.

177
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,225
There are also a limited number of 5th generation
fighters in the vicinity.

178
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:51,463
There are attack helicopters
and vintage aircraft for support purposes.

179
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,765
There are even a few old F-14s.

180
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,768
I guess we were the only ones who ﻿couldn't get rid of nostalgia .

181
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,238
What is your assessment, Captain?

182
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,508
Sir, normally..

183
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,011
... with the F-35s flying in silent mode
, this would be child's play.

184
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,380
But not working GPS
throws it away.

185
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,949
The threat on the surface
appears to be small.

186
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:14,686
Laser guided attack.
I think it's achievable with an F-18.

187
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,589
Two bombs ﻿dropped right on target . Minimum.

188
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,125
4 planes flying in pairs.

189
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,360
There
's quite a ramp to get out of here.

190
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:25,363
We'll be in the clear for the missiles ﻿at the summit .

191
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,565
Even if we get out of here...

192
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,901
... there is a dogfight ﻿until we get home .

193
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,338
You have everything you have learned from ﻿experience .

194
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,306
It's not the same task, sir.

195
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,215
There seems to be no ﻿going back from this .

196
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,518
Can it be done or not?

197
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,420
How long does it take for the facility
to become fully operational?

198
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,556
three weeks. Maybe less.

199
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,426
It's been a while since I 've driven an F-18
and...

200
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,296
...for the other three pilots,
I'm not sure who I can trust.

201
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,165
But I'm
trying to find a way out.

202
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,200
I think you misunderstood, Captain.

203
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,336
- Sir?
- We're not asking you to fly.

204
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,839
We want a teacher.

205
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,009
To teach, sir?

206
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,780
We recruited the best 12 pilots
from their battalions.

207
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,583
We want you to get your numbers down to 6
.

208
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,052
In the mission they will fly.

209
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,923
Is there a problem, Captain?

210
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,693
Do you know ﻿who he is , sir?

211
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,097
Bradley Bradshaw.

212
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,834
Nicknamed "Rooster". You
've flown with his father before.

213
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,335
What was his nickname?

214
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,604
"Goose" efendim.

215
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,707
- What happened was so tragic.
- There's something wrong with Captain Mitchell...

216
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,110
... it was determined that he did not do it and that his death was
an accident.

217
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,478
What do you say, Captain?

218
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,880
Will you take Goose's son?

219
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,120
With all due respect , I
'm not a teacher, sir.

220
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,588
You were a Top Gun
instructor before.

221
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,857
That was 30 years ago
and it took two months.

222
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,792
That's not my place.

223
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,794
Let me be as clear as possible.

224
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,231
You were not my first choice.
You're not the only one on the list.

225
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,601
You are here at the ﻿request of Admiral Kazansky .

226
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,738
Iceman is someone I
respect a lot.

227
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,508
He seems to think you have something left ﻿to offer the Navy .

228
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,744
But I can't imagine it.

229
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,914
You don't have to accept this job.

230
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,849
But let me be clear.

231
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,819
This will be your last mission, Captain.

232
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,857
You either fly for Top Gun, or you
never fly again for the Navy.

233
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,082
It didn't go very well.

234
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:05,190
The child is not ready for this task.

235
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,760
Nobody?

236
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,529
That's why you're here.

237
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,135
You could have warned me.

238
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:21,206
Would you come then?

239
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,845
You must be kidding.

240
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,582
Pete.

241
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,917
Penny?

242
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,322
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same.

243
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:39,424
It's a long story.

244
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,060
- I doubt it.
- Yes...

245
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,063
- Who did you piss off this time?
- Another Admiral.

246
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,931
It sure is.

247
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,269
- Are you angry with me?
- Oh, Pete...

248
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,838
I can never stay mad at you.

249
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,406
That's the problem.

250
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,945
I never thought I 'd run into ﻿you in Northern Ireland .

251
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:05,049
- How long have you been here?
- It's been 3 years since I bought this place.

252
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,484
3 years?

253
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:11,222
Shortly after you angered the other Admiral and was driven into the desert
.

254
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,259
Was this 3 years ago?

255
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,896
You must be in big trouble.

256
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,365
It is not possible for you to come here willingly
.

257
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,935
Neyse...

258
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,770
You will find a way.

259
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,805
No, I guess..

260
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,941
I think I'm done.

261
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,709
Hadi, Pete.

262
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,711
I know you , you
're saying this since I got to know you.

263
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:38,082
You said you'd take me for a ride in that F-18
.

264
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,885
And I saw that you are going to Bosnia.

265
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,987
And Iraq.

266
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,555
Both times.

267
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,524
You got yourself in trouble.

268
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,794
Iceman made a phone call
and you're back here.

269
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,062
Penny, this is different.

270
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,097
Pete, trust me.

271
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,866
Given the current odds...

272
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:58,770
somehow you'll be in a fighter plane ﻿with your tail on fire.

273
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,073
- Penny...
- It's too late.

274
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:05,710
- What?
- You're about to ask when I'm leaving.

275
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,015
Don't give me that look.

276
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,117
I'm not looking at you.

277
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,786
I swear.

278
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,288
The end is always the same for us, Pete.

279
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,858
Let's not start this time.

280
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,197
Peki.

281
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,199
Peki.

282
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,172
you look good.

283
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,750
Thank you very much, mate.

284
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,854
What am I missing?

285
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:58,062
- If you disrespect a woman or put her phone down...
- Drinks are on you next.

286
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,297
Herkese mi?

287
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:02,600
Rules are rules, I'm afraid.
You're lucky it's early.

288
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,303
If so!

289
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,638
Who is that here?

290
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,309
Yüzbaşı Phoenix.

291
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,112
I thought they ﻿only got the specials here , Coyote.

292
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,483
It turns out that
they were inviting anyone who came before them.

293
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,519
- Gentlemen, this is friend Bagman.
- Hangman.

294
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,920
Well, anyway.

295
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:27,191
You're looking at the only Navy team that ﻿has taken down an enemy during active duty .

296
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,659
- Stop.
- Came to mind...

297
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,429
Yours is in a museum,
right? from the Korean War.

298
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:35,066
- Cold War.
- It was in the same century, after all.

299
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,534
Not in this century.

300
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,404
- Who are your friends?
- Payback. - Fanboy.

301
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,339
- Hey, Coyote.
- Hey.

302
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,474
- Who is this?
- Who is who?

303
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,912
When did you come in?

304
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,214
I was always here already.

305
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,184
- The man is a silent flight pilot.
- Literally.

306
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,319
Weapons systems officer, actually.

307
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,789
With no sense of humor.

308
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,193
- What do they call you?
- Bob.

309
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,995
No, that's your nickname.

310
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,366
Bob.

311
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,234
Bob Floyd.

312
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,403
Will you sit behind me?

313
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:15,473
- From LeMoire?
- It seems so.

314
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,912
Masaya gel, Bob.

315
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,281
Vur hadi.

316
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,917
Tamam.

317
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,386
- Penny, dear?
- Yes.

318
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,855
You write ﻿four more on the old rifle .

319
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,773
Bradshaw!

320
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,342
is that you?

321
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,916
Is this how I would find out that you still fly
?

322
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,152
Yeah, I thought I'd ﻿surprise you .

323
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,257
I guess I
surprised you too.

324
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,694
- Good to see you.
- You too.

325
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,731
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

326
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,800
Thanks, daddy.

327
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,177
Shall we close the account before they rob me
of it?

328
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,394
Bradshaw? Bloody before me.

329
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,131
hangman? You look good.

330
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,334
İyiyim, Rooster.

331
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,405
I am very good. Even...

332
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,874
I'm too good to be true.

333
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:00,645
Do any of you know the subject of ﻿this special gathering ?

334
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,413
Duty is duty.

335
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,482
It's not a problem for me.

336
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,552
What I want to know...
is who will be the team leader.

337
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,955
And which of you
has what it takes.

338
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,823
to follow me.

339
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,861
Hangman,
the only place to go after you is an early grave.

340
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,506
If the one who follows you...

341
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,107
...runs out of fuel...

342
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:33,010
Do you remember last year
, Rooster?

343
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,813
He wanted so much to show ﻿himself in that test .

344
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,683
You were waiting for the right moment.

345
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,420
The one who never came.

346
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,692
I love this.

347
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,434
This hasn't changed.

348
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,804
No. Unchanged.

349
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,376
Look at this.

350
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,578
More pilots.

351
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:11,182
Harvard, Yale,
Omaha... Fuck it, that's Fritz.

352
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,084
What kind of task is this?

353
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,287
That's not the question we should be asking.

354
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,223
Everyone here is one of the best.

355
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,560
Who will they hire to ﻿teach us ?

356
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,732
The map is worth it.

357
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,467
You're kidding.

358
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,483
Hey guys.

359
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,184
Come on like this.

360
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,333
The one on me ...

361
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:05,036
That's not enough.

362
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,643
I'll be back ﻿tomorrow with cash .

363
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,712
Korkarım ki ...

364
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,148
...rules are rules, Pete.

365
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,721
Let's throw it out!

366
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,190
- Let's throw it out!
- Are you serious?

367
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,825
Let's throw it out!

368
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:36,867
Let's throw it out!

369
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,471
It was good to see you, Pete.

370
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,276
Let's throw it out!

371
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,178
Evet!

372
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,580
Thanks for the beers. Come
back whenever you want.

373
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,344
İrtifa 8.000.

374
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,413
I'm falling fast

375
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,081
I can't reach the launch arm.

376
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,250
Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!

377
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,657
Goose! Dayan!

378
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,927
He loved flying with you
, Maverick.

379
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,139
Dikkat!

380
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,351
Günaydın.

381
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,420
Welcome to your ﻿special education continent.

382
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,055
Oturun.

383
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:14,091
This is Air Commander Admiral Bates.

384
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,293
You're all Top Gun graduates.

385
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,362
You are elite pilots.

386
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,397
You are the best of the best.

387
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,666
These are yesterday.

388
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:27,538
The enemy's new 5th generation fighter
jet has leveled the playing field.

389
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,607
Details are few, but
now its technological advantage...

390
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,675
...
you can rest assured that we don't have it.

391
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,845
Success is now more
than ever...

392
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,915
... attached to a woman or a man ﻿inside a box .

393
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,718
Half of you
will pass the elimination.

394
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,420
One of you will be designated as the mission leader
.

395
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:46,323
The remaining half
will remain as reinforcements.

396
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,527
Your instructor is also a
Top Gun graduate.

397
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:53,931
He has real-world experience in ﻿every mission you are expected to master .

398
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,568
Their achievements are legendary.

399
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:01,572
He is widely regarded as one of ﻿the best pilots this program has produced .

400
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,840
oh my god.

401
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:09,380
What they teach you can make
the difference between your death and your life.

402
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,216
Introducing Captain
Pete Mitchell.

403
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,586
Lakabı, Maverick.

404
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,293
Günaydın.

405
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,535
FAT guides.

406
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,173
It contains everything they want you to ﻿know about the program .

407
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,577
I assume you know ﻿the contents of this book .

408
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,012
- That's right!
- Yes, we know.

409
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,389
Your enemy knows too.

410
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,325
Here we go.

411
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,061
But what the enemy doesn't know...

412
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,862
... your limits.

413
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,497
I intend to find them.

414
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,768
I want to test and force.

415
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,571
Just what you know today..

416
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,007
... we'll start with your chests.

417
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,243
Show me what
you can do.

418
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,450
Rooster?

419
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,885
Bradley?

420
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,988
Teğmen Bradshaw?

421
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,124
Yes, sir.

422
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,560
Let's leave this formality
aside.

423
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,429
Are you going to kick me out of the team?

424
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,399
It's up to you, not me.

425
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,303
can i go

426
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,822
Good morning, Airmen.
Your captain is speaking.

427
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,924
Welcome to basic flight maneuvers.

428
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,362
As reported, our
exercise today is dogfighting.

429
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,131
Guns only. No missiles.

430
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,934
We will not go below the 5,000 feet limit
.

431
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:14,338
You have to work as a team and
shoot me or else...

432
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,839
Or what, sir?

433
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,541
Or I will shoot you.

434
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,244
If I shoot one of you,
you both lose.

435
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,346
This guy's ego
check

436
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,914
We'll handle it.

437
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,582
Let's make the game a little better,
shall we?

438
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:29,353
- What's on your mind?
- Whoever gets hit first should do 200 push-ups.

439
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,022
I don't like doing push-ups.

440
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,858
They don't call it exercise
for nothing, sir.

441
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,794
Agreed then, gentlemen.

442
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,962
The fight has begun. Let's go to work.

443
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,032
Fanboy, do you see it?

444
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,701
There's nothing ahead on the radar.

445
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,602
It must be somewhere behind us.

446
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,306
- It's bad!
- Whoa!

447
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,641
No more!

448
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,046
Ağır ol, Maverick.

449
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,482
Let's not get fired from day one.

450
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,884
Charlie, down! Down!
Maverick is coming!

451
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,053
- Let's break up!
- Let's break up!

452
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,057
Hangman, where's your fireman?

453
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,526
- Rooster, where are you?
- I've got your back, man.

454
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,729
I'm coming. Hold on, hold on!

455
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,697
Acele and, dostum! And Acele!

456
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,335
We have to leave!

457
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,837
do you see it?

458
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,573
Rooster just
saw the light, fellas.

459
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,141
And it cost him dearly.

460
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:25,909
Not this time, old man.

461
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,380
You cannot escape like this.

462
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,219
damn it.

463
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,690
Rooster, you're way down.
You're under the limit!

464
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,359
Hassiktir!

465
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,598
Öldün.

466
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:48,899
Woe to your mother.

467
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,701
189.

468
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,437
That's how it is. 190...

469
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,040
We should have been there.

470
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,942
But we are not.

471
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,779
And now you know something ﻿about the Rooster .

472
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,183
We'll get another one when we get back
, okay?

473
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,018
OK, pose.

474
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,055
- You're dead.
- Damn!

475
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,324
- You were shot.
- Wow!

476
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:18,295
Everything feels fun until you get hit
.

477
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:21,899
Phoenix, how about you tell everyone what Bob stands
for?

478
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,133
- No need to hide.
- I'm in.

479
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,301
Don't get hooked, Bob.

480
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,069
Wanna know why we call him Hangman
?

481
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,739
Wait, wait, I found it.
"Baby Sitting Here."

482
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,643
Hassiktir lan!

483
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:34,978
Good morning, Airmen.

484
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,380
The fight has begun.

485
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,849
All right, Phoenix.
Let's get this guy down.

486
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,284
Arkanı kolla, Phoenix.

487
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,486
- Right wing!
- I'm breaking to the right!

488
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,890
- Where is this going?
- That's why we call him Hangman.

489
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,692
It always leaves you in the middle.

490
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:50,828
It means leaving your ﻿burning man .

491
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,930
A tactic I haven't seen in a ﻿long time .

492
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,065
He called you a man, Phoenix.
Will you accept this?

493
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,000
Unless he calls you a man.

494
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:00,604
- Where's Maverick, Bob?
- God, his nose almost went in.

495
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,873
Get him after me, Hangman!

496
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,708
To the attention of our viewers at home.

497
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,610
That's how fossils are buried.

498
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,812
All right, Hangman. It's time to teach you
a lesson.

499
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,181
- You're dead, Phoenix.
- Son of a bitch!

500
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,285
Let's go, Mav!
Let's see what you got!

501
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:16,753
Come on!

502
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,457
You'll be done soon.
Hangman is coming.

503
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,660
Yes, we will see it.

504
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,437
It's sensitive. Phoenix can't see it.
How close am I?

505
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,039
- Phoenix?
- I'm dead, dickhead.

506
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,075
See you in the afterlife, Bagman.

507
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,278
Where is this? Where?

508
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,180
Öldün.

509
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,948
79!

510
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,383
Yere! 80!

511
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,819
All right, who's next?

512
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,722
- I shot you, Omaha.
- Damn!

513
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,092
Vuruldun, Coyote.

514
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,827
This must be a joke.

515
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,229
Yere! 71!

516
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,431
Yere! 72!

517
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,870
Rooster, can I ask you a personal
question?

518
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,772
If I say you can't ask,
won't you ask?

519
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,741
What's your story with Maverick?

520
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,442
It seems like it got you a little nervous
.

521
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,212
- It's none of your business.
- Where is this man?

522
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,080
I was always here.

523
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,817
Hassiktir be...

524
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,021
Do you see now?

525
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:26,490
Come on, let's finish this thing.

526
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,392
The fight has begun!

527
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,529
What's wrong with these two?

528
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,969
Well, you got us here.

529
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,537
How will you remove yourself?

530
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:43,006
You can quit whenever you want!

531
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,443
- How long do you want to continue, Rooster?
- I can do as much as you, sir.

532
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,211
And that's enough for me.

533
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,750
The past is past
. for both of us.

534
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,519
You want to believe that
, right?

535
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,722
You go below the limit.
Your space is running low!

536
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,293
If you want to see us both on the ground
, so be it.

537
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,730
altitude! Altitude!

538
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,803
altitude! Altitude!

539
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,408
Rise, rise!

540
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,545
Rise, rise!

541
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,782
That's how it is. Don't think, just do.

542
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,019
Come on, Rooster. You're on your back!
Get down and take your shot!

543
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,155
I'm so low!

544
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,758
It's too late now. You missed your chance.

545
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,199
Öldün.

546
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,700
Yere in.

547
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,235
damn it!

548
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,371
It's the same Rooster.

549
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,476
Go see Harlow ﻿for your push-ups .

550
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,319
OK, that's enough.

551
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,721
Rooster, that's enough, man.

552
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,505
Going below the limit
? Disobedience?

553
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,807
- Trying to get fired?
- Don't worry about it.

554
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:25,842
Bak...

555
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,778
I'm going on this mission.

556
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:31,481
But if you get fired, you
leave us to fly Hangman.

557
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,216
Talk to me! What was it?

558
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,018
He took out my papers.

559
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,788
Ne? Kim?

560
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,389
Maverick.

561
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,459
He took out my application and
sent it back.

562
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,862
It pushed me back four years.

563
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,000
Why would you do this?

564
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:58,075
The limit is 5000
feet above the ground.

565
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,310
This limit is not just
for the safety of the pilots...

566
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,812
... determined for the safety of ﻿aircraft as well .

567
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,948
5000 feet is not an ordinary
rule, it is a law.

568
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,383
It must be obeyed like the law of gravity!

569
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,718
The limit for the mission will be much
lower, sir.

570
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:12,189
And it cannot be changed without my consent
!

571
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,324
Especially in the
middle of a workout.

572
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,460
And that cobra maneuver?

573
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:17,961
He could have killed all three of you.

574
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,097
I never want to see ﻿this bullshit again.

575
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,400
What exactly did you
think you were teaching, Captain?

576
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,902
No matter how good they are, they
still have something to learn, sir.

577
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,572
You're talking about the best fighter-plane
pilots on the planet, Captain.

578
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,807
And
their careers that will end with them.

579
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:33,977
They will drop bombs from high altitude with little or no
dogfight.

580
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:37,047
The parameters of this mission
require things for which they were never prepared.

581
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,116
To fight as a team
and to a goal...

582
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,851
...to teach how to attack...

583
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:42,853
... you have less than three weeks.

584
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,088
And for their safe return home.

585
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:50,460
They'll be back home safely
, sir.

586
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,501
Every mission has risks.

587
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,103
These pilots accept that.

588
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,072
I don't, sir.

589
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:09,713
Starting today, you will give us your training plans in writing ﻿every morning .

590
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,983
And nothing will be changed ﻿without my written consent .

591
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:16,386
- Including the limit, sir?
- Especially the limit, Captain.

592
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,556
Efendim.

593
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,091
What is this?

594
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,926
Request to lower the limit, sir.

595
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:26,563
For low altitude bomb drill in ﻿mission parameters .

596
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:34,337
You better learn a few things about timing
, Captain.

597
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,339
Hey, Coyote.

598
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,308
Take a look at this.

599
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,481
The man is a legend. It's over there.

600
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,716
No, no. next to it.

601
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,153
Is it familiar?

602
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,523
What is it here?

603
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,926
Bradshaw.

604
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:58,995
It's like a living tomb.

605
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,233
Hey, Theo.

606
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:06,736
- But you've grown.
- Hey, Mav.

607
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:16,246
- Emilia?
- I know. I've grown a lot.

608
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,747
Evet.

609
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,016
If you want a drink, get it yourself.

610
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,619
No, I stopped
by to pay my debt.

611
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,154
Anne!

612
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:31,728
- Hey, how's your dad?
- He's in Hawaii with his wife.

613
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,363
Anne!

614
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,932
Mav says he brought your money.

615
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,134
Never mind.

616
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,936
I insist.

617
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,374
Thank you, Captain.

618
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,509
Say your account is closed.

619
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,878
Captain? still?

620
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,481
A Captain with many medals.

621
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,551
Finish it. We have to get the boat
repaired.

622
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,020
- I can't come.
- What do you mean you can't come?

623
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,722
There is a test tomorrow. I need to work.

624
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:00,457
They reported today.

625
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,726
I can't take him alone.

626
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,527
You use the engine.

627
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:06,596
Why are we taking it for repair?

628
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,632
- To get the engine repaired.
- To get the engine repaired.

629
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,400
I can help.

630
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,375
We don't always stand by like this.

631
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,076
Yapma ya?

632
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,945
According to the wind direction..

633
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,247
- ﻿...we set sail.
- OK.

634
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,349
What does this mean?

635
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,086
And you'll be in my navy!

636
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,355
I'm not driving, Penny.

637
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,057
I'm landing on them.

638
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,227
No more difficult than steering an airplane.

639
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,029
How will I do it?

640
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,232
Pulling the green rope over there.

641
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:43,867
Yeşil halat ...

642
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,637
Yes, pull hard!

643
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:50,540
Uradaki kola sar!

644
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,375
He will open the mainsail!

645
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,711
- Flip, with all your might!
- OK!

646
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,114
Güzel.

647
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,383
Şimdi...

648
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,952
are you ready?

649
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,122
Neye?

650
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:08,858
Additional speed.

651
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,180
Now you're from the Navy.

652
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,204
Thanks for ﻿helping out on the boat .

653
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:57,707
I
'm not sure I'm helping.

654
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,581
Don't give me that look.

655
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,149
Which look?

656
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,817
that's it.

657
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:12,589
Good night, Pete.

658
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,524
Good night, Penny.

659
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,488
Time is your worst enemy.

660
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:50,760
Stage 1 of the mission
is to advance at low altitude in two teams.

661
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:53,396
You will reach your destination through this narrow
canyon.

662
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:56,733
The area smells of radar-mounted heat
-seeking missiles.

663
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,536
These missiles are deadly.

664
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,773
But they are designed to protect the sky above
, not the canyon below.

665
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:07,444
Because the enemy knows that no one
is crazy enough to fly under them.

666
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,880
That's exactly what
I'm going to train you for.

667
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:14,184
On mission day, your altitude
will be 1000 feet.

668
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,685
Maksimum.

669
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:19,088
If you pass this altitude, the
radar will catch you...

670
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,357
...and you die.

671
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,727
Your speed will be 660 knots.

672
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,095
Minimum.

673
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:29,199
Arrival time at destination 2.5 minutes.

674
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:33,236
This is because of the 5th generation warplanes waiting at the ﻿nearby airport .

675
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,840
If you encounter ﻿these planes in an F-18 ...

676
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,075
... you will die.

677
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,212
So
before these planes even have a chance to catch you...

678
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:45,014
... you must enter, hit your target
and disappear.

679
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:48,618
This makes time your biggest competitor.

680
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,656
Your navigation system
has a simulation of the canyon.

681
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,692
The faster you cross ﻿this canyon ...

682
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:59,229
... the more difficult it will be for you to stay ﻿under the radar and stay away from enemy planes .

683
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:04,133
As the turns get harder , the
force of gravity on your body increases exponentially.

684
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,569
It compresses your lungs...

685
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:08,204
It forces the blood in your brain to flow...

686
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:11,140
It affects your decisions and
reaction time.

687
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:14,043
They asked me not to overload you.

688
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:17,213
So your altitude is 1,300 feet
and your time to destination is 3 minutes.

689
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:20,350
Good luck.

690
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,157
Dostum...

691
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:31,227
We are 1.30 minutes
away from the destination. We're two seconds behind.

692
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:32,562
We must increase our speed by 80 knots.

693
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,898
Hızlanmalıyız, Coyote.

694
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,866
Got it, I'm increasing the speed.

695
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:39,969
Hassiktir!

696
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:46,175
- Why did they die?
- We've crossed the 300-foot limit.

697
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,577
And the missiles took us down.

698
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:50,780
- No. Why did they die?
- I slowed down and didn't give him a warning.

699
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,483
- It was my fault.
- For not communicating with your team.

700
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,719
- I'm sorry, sir...
- Will their families accept this at their funeral?

701
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,422
No, sir.

702
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,659
Why didn't you anticipate the return?
You were informed in training.

703
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,661
Don't tell me.

704
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,230
Tell his family.

705
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,903
Hangman, be heavy!
The canyon narrows.

706
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,172
No problem,
Payback. Increase your speed.

707
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,576
You're going too fast, man!

708
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:22,078
It wouldn't hurt to arrive first.

709
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:25,348
Damn, slow down

710
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,416
I can't stay on course!

711
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:29,586
There's a wall in front of you!
Attention, attention, attention!

712
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,692
- What happened?
- I flew as fast as I could.

713
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,027
As if my life depended on it.

714
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:41,230
And he put his team in danger
and your yandere is dead.

715
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,233
They couldn't reach me.

716
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:52,375
Rooster! We're 20 seconds
behind and it's increasing!

717
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,978
we are fine! Maintain your speed.

718
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,113
We're going 500 nautical miles.

719
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,781
Just keep your speed.

720
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,016
Rooster, we're running late!

721
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:02,752
We're alive though. We'll make up for it later
.

722
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,754
Başaramayacağız!

723
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,789
Listen to me! Maintain your speed.

724
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,057
Başarabiliriz.

725
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,293
Why did you die?

726
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,628
You are the team leader above.

727
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:14,163
Why did you and your team die

728
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:17,233
Sir,
he was the only one to reach the target.

729
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,868
One minute late.

730
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,938
He gave the ﻿enemy planes time to land him .

731
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:23,373
- He's dead.
- You can't know that.

732
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,742
You're not flying fast enough.

733
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:27,310
We don't have a
second to waste.

734
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:30,947
- We've reached the goal.
- And superior enemy planes...

735
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,515
... cut you off while you were leaving.

736
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,518
- Then it's a dogfight.
- Against 5th generation warplanes.

737
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:36,819
Yes, we still have a chance.

738
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,689
- In an F-18.
- It's not on the plane, sir.

739
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:42,525
- It's on the pilot.
- Exactly!

740
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,601
There is more than one way to ﻿fly in this mission .

741
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,603
You really don't understand.

742
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:57,373
In this mission a man
either flies like a Maverick...

743
00:52:57,408 --> 00:52:59,676
...or he can't come back.

744
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,078
There is no resentment to be offended.

745
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:04,847
But you still
succeed every time.

746
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:09,052
You better listen to the ﻿criticisms a little bit .

747
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:10,119
That's all. Lieutenant...

748
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,422
We're going to war, son.

749
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:14,991
The kind that no living pilot
has ever seen.

750
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:18,094
Onun bile.

751
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:21,831
Now is not the time to ﻿think about the past .

752
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,303
- What does that mean now?
- Rooster.

753
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,139
I can't be the only one who knows that ﻿Maverick flew with his father .

754
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:32,508
- That's enough.
- And while Maverick was flying with his father...

755
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,043
Hey! Hey!

756
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:35,712
For sure! Enough!

757
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:38,014
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey, come on!

758
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:40,183
No hassle. I am fine.

759
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,052
- That's enough.
- He's not fit for the job.

760
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:45,288
- Enough!
- You know this.

761
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,126
You know him, don't you?

762
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,467
You can all disperse.

763
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,184
We need to meet.

764
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,625
It's not a good time.

765
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,962
I'm not asking.

766
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:02,965
Maverick.

767
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:06,769
It's gotten worse.

768
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:09,205
Nobody knows.

769
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,909
There is nothing else I can do.

770
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:16,345
It hurts ﻿even when talking .

771
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,786
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

772
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:45,508
Amiral.

773
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,353
Here is my burner.

774
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,063
I want to talk about business.

775
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,467
Please don't worry about me.

776
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:14,237
what can i do for you

777
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:18,140
I want to talk about work.

778
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:23,779
Peki.

779
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:29,685
Rooster is
still mad at me for what I did.

780
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:33,789
I thought you'd ﻿understand why .

781
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,927
I hope he forgives me.

782
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:40,062
There is still time.

783
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,404
Less than three weeks to the task
.

784
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,072
The child is not ready.

785
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:56,012
So teach him.

786
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,516
It's
not about what I can give him.

787
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:03,185
Ice, please.

788
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,055
Don't ask me to send ﻿another person to die , please.

789
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,258
Don't ask me to send it.

790
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:11,127
send me

791
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:28,978
It's time to quit.

792
00:57:42,259 --> 00:57:44,627
I don't know how.

793
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,408
I'm not a teacher, Ice.

794
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:03,713
I am a fighter jet pilot.

795
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,750
The Navy wants me to train.

796
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:12,421
I'm not this.

797
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:14,757
This is my personality.

798
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:18,227
How can I teach this?

799
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,798
Even if I could teach,
that's not what Rooster wants.

800
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,634
That's not what the Navy wants.

801
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,738
That's why they came to me last
time.

802
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:34,243
You 're the only reason ﻿I'm here .

803
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:43,419
If I send him on this mission...

804
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,722
... he may never return home.

805
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,428
And if I don't send him...

806
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,730
... will never forgive me.

807
00:58:56,633 --> 00:59:00,169
Either way, I
will lose him forever.

808
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:08,244
It's time to quit.

809
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,714
Biliyorum.

810
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,382
Biliyorum...

811
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:27,830
The Navy needs the Maverick.

812
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:33,702
The boy needs Maverick.

813
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,440
That's why I vouched for you.

814
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,577
That's why you're still here.

815
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:50,953
Teşekkürler, Ice.

816
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,422
for everything.

817
00:59:57,461 --> 00:59:59,361
One last thing.

818
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:03,232
Which of us was the better
pilot? You or me?

819
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,604
Let's not ruin this beautiful moment.

820
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,202
Come on, here we go!

821
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:44,193
- Sir?
- What is this?

822
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,894
Dogfight football.

823
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,696
Attack and defense at the same time.

824
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,498
Who is winning?

825
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:52,368
I guess they stopped keeping score a long
time ago.

826
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:55,170
The team still has a week of
practice, Captain.

827
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,373
- Every minute counts.
- Yes sir.

828
01:02:57,407 --> 01:02:59,908
So why are we
playing games here?

829
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,578
You told me to form a team
, sir.

830
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:05,347
Here is your team.

831
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:46,915
Should I go before Emilia returns?

832
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,784
He's staying with his friend tonight.

833
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:55,023
You and Emilia are much more...

834
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:59,228
...you seem close...
compared to the last time I saw it.

835
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:02,498
Yes. We are.

836
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,701
Şey...

837
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:09,772
He wanted more freedom than ﻿I thought he was ready for .

838
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,108
Who did he get this from?

839
01:05:15,712 --> 01:05:18,814
That I should trust him...

840
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:21,517
... I finally realized it.

841
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:25,154
I have to let ﻿him make his own mistakes every now and then.

842
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,324
It's not an easy choice.

843
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,764
Is that what happened with the Rooster?

844
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:42,304
I pulled out your paperwork from ﻿the Naval Academy .

845
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,242
I stole years from your career.

846
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,383
Neden?

847
01:05:56,986 --> 01:06:00,789
After what happened to Goose, I
couldn't let him fly.

848
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:06,061
He made me promise before he died.

849
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:08,564
Does Rooster know this?

850
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:15,237
He will always hate me ﻿for what I did .

851
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:19,675
Why would I send it then?

852
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:26,381
It's not an easy choice.

853
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:31,954
I was trying to be the ﻿father he lost .

854
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:36,024
Sadece...

855
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:40,696
I wish I had done it differently.

856
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,568
The truth is...

857
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:50,572
I didn't think you were ready.

858
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,944
Is it ready now?

859
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:00,616
Mom, I'm here!

860
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:04,219
You were supposed to stay in Caron tonight
?

861
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:06,788
Caron was
going somewhere with her family!

862
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:09,324
- I'd better go.
- You better go.

863
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:12,394
Did you eat?

864
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,664
No, it's okay. I
'll prepare something for you.

865
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:17,833
I'm getting off right now!

866
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:19,768
wait! Not from there.

867
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:24,106
Look, I need to be an example.

868
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,108
I can't be the woman who brings a ﻿man home on a first date .

869
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,143
This is not our first date!

870
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,379
You know what I mean.

871
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,050
Pekala.

872
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:40,088
OK. But I'm getting out of the
window for the last time, just so you know.

873
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:42,024
- We'll see.
- No.

874
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:43,559
No, I'm serious.

875
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,661
I will not leave you again.

876
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,697
Shut up!

877
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:50,832
Come on, get out of here!

878
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,782
Is he still nagging?

879
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,461
Günaydın.

880
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:21,997
Your target is the uranium
enrichment plant...

881
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:23,999
...
will start working sooner than expected.

882
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,603
The raw uranium
will be delivered to the plant in 10 days.

883
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:30,372
As a result, your mission
has been pushed forward a week.

884
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:34,676
To avoid contaminating ﻿the target valley with radiation .

885
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:37,980
Sir, no one here has successfully completed the low-altitude
course.

886
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,215
Yet you have been ordered to advance.

887
01:08:40,984 --> 01:08:42,618
Yüzbaşı.

888
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:47,723
2.
We have one week to focus on Phase .

889
01:08:47,757 --> 01:08:49,524
The most dangerous part of the mission.

890
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:53,328
A hard dive that required ﻿two miracles in a row, and...

891
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:55,097
... to leave the package.

892
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,400
Two pairs of F-
18s will advance to the target, maintaining their attack pattern.

893
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:01,203
In order for the mission to succeed
and for you to survive...

894
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,674
... it is very important ﻿that these planes work in coordination and as a team.

895
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:08,510
As you know, the facility
is between two mountains.

896
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:12,447
In the last step, you will go straight
into a hard dive.

897
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:16,251
This gives you the
opportunity to maintain the lowest possible altitude and...

898
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:19,720
...will recognize a single angle of attack.

899
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:26,662
Your target is in an area of ﻿​​less than 3 meters .

900
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,932
The first two aircraft will
paint the target with a laser sight.

901
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,503
The first pair is placed in an exposed
vent...

902
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:37,973
... will drop a laser-guided bomb
and hit the reactor.

903
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,509
This will leave an open space ﻿for the second couple .

904
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,844
This was the first miracle.

905
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,616
The second team
will deliver the killing blow.

906
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,153
And it will destroy the target.

907
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,889
This is the second miracle.

908
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,692
If either team misses the target...

909
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,962
- I missed!
- Mission fails.

910
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,964
damn it.

911
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:06,968
You will have to make a hard
ascent to avoid hitting the mountain.

912
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,741
You'd eat at least 8 Gs on ﻿that steep ascent at that speed .

913
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:14,376
9. Minimum.

914
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:17,112
The fuselage of the F-18s is
designed for 7.5 G.

915
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:18,213
That's the accepted limit.

916
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,316
You will endure more ﻿to survive this mission .

917
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,819
Even if it means ﻿twisting your torso .

918
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:28,223
Your heartbeat will accelerate and
you will feel pressure close to 4 tons.

919
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,926
Your skull will crush your spine.

920
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,762
Your lungs will explode as ﻿if an elephant is sitting on your chest .

921
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:38,200
You will fight with ﻿all your might just not to faint.

922
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,838
And right here
you will be the most vulnerable.

923
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:46,742
This is... the coffin corner.

924
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:49,511
Assuming you avoid ﻿hitting this mountain ...

925
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:53,148
... you will go straight into enemy radar and you will
lose your privacy.

926
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:56,284
Within seconds, enemy
missiles will be fired at you.

927
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,455
You've all had
a malfunction in the air before...

928
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,859
...but this will bring you to the point of destroying ﻿both you and your plane .

929
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,129
Sir, can this task be
accomplished?

930
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:09,264
The answer to this question is...

931
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:12,267
Depends on the pilot in the box.

932
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,945
- Talk to me, Bob.
- We're 12 seconds late to the destination.

933
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,213
- We have to speed up. We must speed up.
- Fuck it.

934
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:26,782
Got it.
Try to stay with me .

935
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,120
Who is this?

936
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,689
Blue Team, your place has been determined.

937
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:37,125
- Fuck it, it's Maverick.
- What is he doing here?

938
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,194
I am an enemy plane ﻿coming to intercept you.

939
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:40,462
Blue Team, what will you do?

940
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,498
20 km. away, in the direction of 10.
It's not too close.

941
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:45,167
You have the word. What would you like to do?

942
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,502
We continue. We're close.

943
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:48,870
Hedefte kal

944
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:50,639
turned north

945
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,041
- Prepare for ascension.
- Stand by at the laser, Bob.

946
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,409
Got it, I'm waiting.

947
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,679
Blue Team, the enemy
is still approaching.

948
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:59,114
I'm rising now!

949
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,289
Congratulations, Bob! Maverick down?

950
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,291
10 km. away, coming fast!

951
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:16,731
In the target field of view.

952
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,099
Where's my laser, Bob?

953
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:20,035
Does not lock, does not lock!

954
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,736
It doesn't work. Sorry, I can't
lock it!

955
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,772
So I'm shooting blind!

956
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:28,376
Damn, I missed!

957
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,057
- I shot you.
- Leave me alone, brothers.

958
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,792
It's silly, we're dead.

959
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,961
Blue Team, you failed.

960
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,495
Balance your wings, Coyote.

961
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:51,399
Coyote, balance your wings!

962
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,271
Coyote, answer!

963
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,874
Coyote, balance your wings!

964
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:00,775
He's sick, he's unconscious.

965
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,878
Coyote?!

966
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,412
Çakılacak!

967
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:06,014
I'm chasing after you!

968
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:11,653
Hadi, his ver bana! Its worms!

969
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,189
Get rid of it, Coyote.

970
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,928
Until, Coyote. Until, until!

971
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,931
Cevap ver, Coyote!

972
01:13:23,299 --> 01:13:25,033
Coyote! Coyote!

973
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,873
Coyote, are you okay?

974
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:36,177
İyiyim.

975
01:13:36,212 --> 01:13:37,979
Beautiful, beautiful.

976
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,848
Enough for today.

977
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,684
This was close.

978
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:44,419
He was too close.

979
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,321
flock of birds! Herd of birds

980
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,623
A flock of birds?

981
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,695
Phoenix, right engine on fire!

982
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,096
Yükseliyorum!

983
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,198
I'm speeding.

984
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,234
I turn off the fuel on the right engine.

985
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,702
I'm putting out the fire.

986
01:14:02,972 --> 01:14:05,040
- Right engine stalled.
- It's still spinning.

987
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,374
I'm trying to reboot.

988
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:09,644
Your tail is on fire!
Make a sharp turn!

989
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:11,046
Hızlanıyorum.

990
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,782
damn it.

991
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,253
We are burning. We're on fire!

992
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:20,221
- Damn it!
- Fire in the engine.

993
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,791
I'm extinguishing both engines!

994
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,529
Phoenix, Bob! Jump, jump!

995
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,764
There are malfunctions everywhere!
All values ​​are dropping!

996
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,733
- System malfunction.
- I can't control it.

997
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,135
We're falling, Phoenix? We're falling!

998
01:14:34,337 --> 01:14:37,072
You have no other chance!
Throw it! Throw it!

999
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,941
Throw it! Throw it!

1000
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:05,900
They will watch them for a while longer.

1001
01:15:05,935 --> 01:15:07,535
But they will be fine.

1002
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,640
Kaybettik.

1003
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,979
I almost lost my burner too.

1004
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,181
Şanslısın.

1005
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:22,417
For making it to the last round.

1006
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:26,688
There will be others.

1007
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,925
It's easy for you to say.

1008
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,994
You don't have a wife...

1009
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,330
You have no children...

1010
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,133
There's no one to mourn when you crash
.

1011
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,837
Evine git.

1012
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:45,573
Let's get some sleep.

1013
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:50,011
Why did you take out my papers ﻿at the academy ?

1014
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,480
Why did you get in my way?!

1015
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,683
You were not ready.

1016
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,352
What was I not ready for?

1017
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:00,522
- To fly like you?
- No.

1018
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,891
Don't forget the book.
To trust your instincts.

1019
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:05,026
Not thinking, just doing.

1020
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,694
If you start thinking above, you
will die.

1021
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,229
Believe me.

1022
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,732
My father believed in you too.

1023
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:15,470
I will not make the same mistake.

1024
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:22,811
Maverick.

1025
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:36,291
Ready, aim, fire!

1026
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:45,033
Ready, aim, fire!

1027
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,645
Ready, aim, fire!

1028
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:59,948
Ready, aim, fire!

1029
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,885
It's impossible for me to understand ﻿what you're feeling right now .

1030
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,255
Take some time off.
whatever you need.

1031
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:43,491
Thank you sir
, but there is no time. Task...

1032
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:46,127
I'm taking over the authority here.

1033
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:47,996
Efendim?

1034
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:51,332
- We both know you don't want this job.
- Sir, they're not ready.

1035
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:52,934
It was your job to prepare them.

1036
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,070
They must believe that ﻿this mission can succeed .

1037
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:59,073
But you failed to do so.

1038
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,644
- Sir...
- You're grounded, Captain.

1039
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,779
permanently.

1040
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:10,318
- Sir...
- That's it.

1041
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:29,771
Duydum.

1042
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,141
Üzgünüm.

1043
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:35,510
What will you do?

1044
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,346
Ice is no more.

1045
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,150
What other choice do I have?

1046
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:44,819
You have to find a way back yourself
.

1047
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:47,855
Penny...

1048
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:50,558
That's it from me.

1049
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:53,628
This is over.

1050
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:57,165
Pete, even if
you lost your firefight in mid-air...

1051
01:18:57,433 --> 01:18:59,467
You keep fighting.

1052
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,636
You just don't give up.

1053
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,639
They are your pilots.

1054
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:07,609
If anything happens to them...

1055
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,511
... you can never forgive yourself.

1056
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:16,017
I don't know what to do.

1057
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:22,056
But you will find a way.

1058
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:25,860
I know you.

1059
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:29,864
Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.

1060
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:32,600
Your new mission parameters ﻿as of today .

1061
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:35,203
Destination
time is now 4 minutes.

1062
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:38,373
You will enter the valley level by
Reducing your speed.

1063
01:19:38,407 --> 01:19:41,009
You shall not exceed ﻿420 nautical miles .

1064
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:43,711
Sir, don't we give their planes
time to spot us?

1065
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:46,948
You have a chance
to get off the plane, Lieutenant.

1066
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:49,784
What are your chances of surviving ﻿hitting the mountain vertically ?

1067
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:52,687
You will be attacking ﻿the target from higher altitude.

1068
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:54,188
It's on the north wall.

1069
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,057
Keeping your laser on target
will be more difficult...

1070
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:58,159
...but you will avoid ﻿the steep climb .

1071
01:19:58,227 --> 01:20:01,095
And then the missiles
will turn us to dust.

1072
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,268
Who is this?

1073
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,438
From Maverick to Field Control.

1074
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,775
I'm entering the Alpha Point.
I want green zone approval.

1075
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:16,477
Maverick, this is Field Control...

1076
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:19,180
Green zone confirmed but...

1077
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,249
I don't see your name on the program
, sir.

1078
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:23,418
It's not too late though.

1079
01:20:23,686 --> 01:20:25,019
Güzel.

1080
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:28,456
Arrival time at new destination
2 minutes 15 seconds.

1081
01:20:28,691 --> 01:20:30,391
2.15 mi? This is impossible.

1082
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:33,294
I'm getting close to the first point.
Maverick is on its way.

1083
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:14,836
Hassiktir.

1084
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,471
Hadi!

1085
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:13,728
Tırmanıyorum. 3, 2, 1.

1086
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:42,056
Bombs are on their way.

1087
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,808
Tam 12'den! Hassiktir!

1088
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,911
Evet.

1089
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:08,249
Woe to your mother.

1090
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:23,197
You put me in a difficult position
, Captain.

1091
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:27,535
On the one hand, you showed that this mission can be
flown.

1092
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:29,971
Maybe the
only way to get out alive.

1093
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,140
On the other hand...

1094
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:36,177
...by smuggling a multimillion-dollar military
property and never again...

1095
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:39,113
...
you did it by using it in a way that it can't take off.

1096
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:42,984
Iceman is no longer
here to protect you.

1097
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,186
It's up to me to take you to
court-martial and...

1098
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,788
... have everything needed to get ﻿kicked out of the army .

1099
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,558
What do you think I should do?

1100
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:54,529
Should I risk the lives of my pilots, and perhaps the
chances of success of this mission...

1101
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,398
...or else...

1102
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,167
... as the leader of the faculty...

1103
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:03,170
...and risk my career
?

1104
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:09,043
- Sir...
- I think the Admiral didn't want an answer to his question.

1105
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,178
Anladım.

1106
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,047
Talk to me, Goose.

1107
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:57,885
Komutan Mitchell.

1108
01:26:04,426 --> 01:26:06,761
You are where you belong.

1109
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:13,367
make us proud.

1110
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:41,195
It was an honor to fly with you.

1111
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:45,299
Each of you
represents the best of the best.

1112
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:49,036
This is a very special mission.

1113
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:53,174
My choices are only
reflections of that.

1114
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,376
First Foxtrot team members.

1115
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:58,579
Payback ve Fanboy.

1116
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,915
Phoenix ve Bob.

1117
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,387
And your fire.

1118
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,993
Rooster.

1119
01:27:16,498 --> 01:27:19,867
The rest of you are
in support roles on board...

1120
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,169
... you will continue to stay.

1121
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:24,338
Dağılabilirsiniz.

1122
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,715
Your target is a threat that needs ﻿immediate attention .

1123
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:39,553
It's a secret
uranium enrichment plant out of surveillance.

1124
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:44,091
In an underground bunker.
Between these two mountains.

1125
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:51,398
There are 5th class warplanes ﻿at a nearby airport in the region .

1126
01:27:51,533 --> 01:27:53,768
After ﻿you take off and cross the border ...

1127
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:57,071
...from the USS Ladygulf to the enemy
's airfield here...

1128
01:27:57,139 --> 01:27:59,907
... synchronized Tomahawk
missiles will be fired.

1129
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:04,044
This will put their tracks
out of play.

1130
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:08,215
But you'll have to deal with
planes that have already taken off.

1131
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,119
As soon as those missiles land
at the airport, they'll know you've arrived.

1132
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:17,324
Your arrival time at the destination
will be 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

1133
01:28:18,193 --> 01:28:23,230
If it takes longer than that, you'll be on the radar of hijacked planes by the ﻿Tomahawks .

1134
01:28:26,568 --> 01:28:29,036
You were trained for this.

1135
01:28:30,739 --> 01:28:32,940
Good luck back home.

1136
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:49,423
Show your days.

1137
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:04,471
Efendim!

1138
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:08,375
Ben...

1139
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:13,180
- I meant...
- All personnel take their seats.

1140
01:29:13,582 --> 01:29:18,986
All personnel take
their places for departure.

1141
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,756
Konuşuruz.

1142
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:25,793
Döndüğümüzde.

1143
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:33,701
Hey, Bradley? Bradley!

1144
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,569
Hey...

1145
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:40,908
You can do this.

1146
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,984
Maverick.

1147
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:53,287
Maverick?

1148
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,624
Hey, are you with me?

1149
01:29:58,026 --> 01:29:59,927
Don't throw that look, man.

1150
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:05,132
I only have this look.

1151
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,504
Thank you.

1152
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,041
If we don't see each other again...

1153
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,010
Thank you.

1154
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:25,286
It was my honor, Captain.

1155
01:30:57,519 --> 01:31:00,821
Dagger-1. Ready for takeoff
and standby.

1156
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:03,057
Dagger-Reinforcement pending.

1157
01:31:03,058 --> 01:31:05,059
Dagger-4 is ready to take off.

1158
01:31:05,093 --> 01:31:06,927
Dagger-3 is ready to take off.

1159
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,396
Dagger-2 is ready to take off.

1160
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:12,666
Reinforcement drone in the air.
The assault team is ready.

1161
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:15,302
We are waiting for orders.

1162
01:31:15,337 --> 01:31:17,037
Gönderin.

1163
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,359
Dagger-2 in the air.

1164
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:41,095
Dagger-3 in the air.

1165
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:43,330
Dagger-4 in the air.

1166
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:54,475
Komanchi, Dagger-1.
Standard control.

1167
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:56,610
Komanchi, Dagger-1.

1168
01:31:58,146 --> 01:31:59,213
Komanchi 1-1, done.

1169
01:31:59,314 --> 01:32:01,482
The image is clean. I recommend Dagger
go ahead.

1170
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:04,385
Got it. We're going under the radar
.

1171
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:24,838
Dagger is under the radar right now.

1172
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:27,307
I switch to snapshot.

1173
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:37,017
Here we are. forward
enemy territory.

1174
01:32:37,085 --> 01:32:38,585
60 seconds to the limit.

1175
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,421
Komanchi, Dagger-1. Image?

1176
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:43,557
Komanchi, the image is
clear. The decision is yours.

1177
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:45,292
Anlaşıldı.

1178
01:32:52,534 --> 01:32:54,435
Dagger, attack.

1179
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,008
Tomahawks took off.

1180
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:03,210
There is no turning back anymore.

1181
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:10,818
Daggers, let's move on to ﻿offensive formation .

1182
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:21,695
The Daggers have been replaced.
We are moving towards the goal^

1183
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:23,197
It starts at 2 minutes 30 seconds.

1184
01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:26,066
3, 2, 1... started.

1185
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:27,935
- 2 okay.
- 3 OK.

1186
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:29,536
4 ok.

1187
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,275
Giriyoruz.

1188
01:33:50,058 --> 01:33:52,226
There are heat-seeking missiles ahead.

1189
01:33:56,531 --> 01:33:58,365
They don't work under the radar
, Mav.

1190
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:00,367
Let's tie our rope to the solid
stake.

1191
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:05,405
More missiles on the hill.

1192
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:09,743
We have 2 minutes left to the target.

1193
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:11,645
Got it. Time
is running out, Rooster.

1194
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:12,646
Hızlanmalıyız.

1195
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:17,151
30 seconds for Tomahawks to land on the ﻿enemy airfield .

1196
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,461
Dagger, Komanchi. We're getting two
enemy signals.

1197
01:34:27,529 --> 01:34:28,795
It's right in front of us. Two contacts.

1198
01:34:28,897 --> 01:34:30,330
Where did these come from?

1199
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,766
Field patrol?

1200
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,172
Komanchi, which way are they going?

1201
01:34:38,206 --> 01:34:39,640
Rotaları 0-9-0-5.

1202
01:34:39,707 --> 01:34:41,675
- They're headed southwest.
- They're moving away from us.

1203
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:42,876
They don't know we are here.

1204
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:47,281
As those Tomahawks land at the airport,
enemy planes will go to cover the target.

1205
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,116
We must be there before they arrive
.

1206
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:50,851
I increase the speed.

1207
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,153
We take care of you,
Mav. Do not wait for me.

1208
01:34:59,494 --> 01:35:02,462
Sir, Dagger
3 and 4 can't keep up.

1209
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,565
Arrival time at destination,
1 minute 20 seconds.

1210
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,635
3, 2...

1211
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:13,307
Düştüler!

1212
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,742
The enemy airbase was destroyed.

1213
01:35:15,777 --> 01:35:17,711
They're all coming now.

1214
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,116
Enemies
change direction towards the target.

1215
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:24,718
Rooster, where are you

1216
01:35:25,587 --> 01:35:28,789
Come on, Rooster! We
have to make up for the time while we can!

1217
01:35:28,856 --> 01:35:30,891
You heard the man.

1218
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:39,533
Affedersin, Phoenix.

1219
01:35:49,277 --> 01:35:51,278
Sir, the enemies
are 2 minutes from the target.

1220
01:35:51,312 --> 01:35:53,280
Daggers
1 minute away from target.

1221
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:55,482
Come on, Rooster. We will lose.

1222
01:35:57,785 --> 01:36:00,654
Guys, we're lagging behind!
We really need to speed up!

1223
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:02,756
If we don't accelerate now
, those enemy planes...

1224
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,025
... it will be close ﻿when we reach the destination !

1225
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:08,895
Talk to me, dad.

1226
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,232
Come on kid,
you can do it. Thinking!

1227
01:36:12,467 --> 01:36:13,900
Sadece yap!

1228
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:17,604
Evet!

1229
01:36:21,175 --> 01:36:23,243
Looks like Rooster
has decided to join us.

1230
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:24,544
That's it, son. That's it!

1231
01:36:24,646 --> 01:36:26,446
All right, we're leaving.

1232
01:36:29,984 --> 01:36:31,752
Rooster, be slow!

1233
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,521
Sir, Dagger-2 is
catching up.

1234
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:37,324
Hit your target and go home.

1235
01:36:42,096 --> 01:36:44,298
30 seconds to target.
Prepare your laser.

1236
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:48,535
1-6-8-8 confirmation code,
laser scanning completed.

1237
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:50,137
The lasers are ready!

1238
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:53,106
Watch out for the heads.

1239
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:55,742
Hassiktir be!

1240
01:36:55,777 --> 01:36:58,278
- Payback, are you with me?
- I'm right behind you.

1241
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,081
Phoenix, prepare to climb.

1242
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:02,482
Dagger-3 took its position.

1243
01:37:03,184 --> 01:37:06,053
Tırmanmaya 3, 2, 1...

1244
01:37:20,802 --> 01:37:22,369
Hassiktir...

1245
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:35,115
Aim the laser, Bob.

1246
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:36,883
Deniyorum...

1247
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:39,553
- Stand by!
- Come on Bob, come on!

1248
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:40,854
Bekleyin

1249
01:37:41,289 --> 01:37:42,356
Thank you! Send!

1250
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:44,758
Target detected. Bombs are on their way.

1251
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:06,380
We hit him, Mav!

1252
01:38:06,414 --> 01:38:08,048
fuck it! Fuck!

1253
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:10,584
The first miracle happened.

1254
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:12,719
Dagger-2, status report.

1255
01:38:12,754 --> 01:38:14,654
I'm about to arrive, Mav. I came!

1256
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:18,725
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1257
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:21,027
Rooster, I can't
lock the laser!

1258
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:23,163
Siktir! From, from, from!

1259
01:38:23,164 --> 01:38:24,531
Come on, guys!
We're running out of time!

1260
01:38:27,168 --> 01:38:28,635
I got it! I caught!

1261
01:38:31,372 --> 01:38:32,873
Hassiktir!

1262
01:38:36,978 --> 01:38:40,080
- Come on, Fanboy. Get it done!
- No time. I'm going to shoot blind.

1263
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:42,015
- Rooster, I'm on it. Wait!
- There's no time left.

1264
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:44,050
Bombs are on the way! bombs on the way

1265
01:38:57,298 --> 01:38:58,498
It's 12! It's 12!

1266
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:04,137
Second miracle.

1267
01:39:04,205 --> 01:39:05,872
The corner of the coffin remained.

1268
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,775
We're not done yet.

1269
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:11,812
Here it begins.

1270
01:39:13,915 --> 01:39:16,716
Missiles took off!
Phohenix, right behind you!

1271
01:39:16,751 --> 01:39:18,485
Got it, I'm back!

1272
01:39:18,553 --> 01:39:20,253
Another one is coming!

1273
01:39:20,855 --> 01:39:22,589
Dagger-1, on the defensive!

1274
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:30,263
Rooster, status report?

1275
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:39,739
oh my god.

1276
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:43,243
Missiles took off!
Missiles took off!

1277
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:45,579
Right wing, Payback! Right wing!

1278
01:39:45,613 --> 01:39:46,780
Dönüyorum!

1279
01:39:46,848 --> 01:39:48,715
oh my god! Coming!

1280
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,384
How do we get rid of them?!

1281
01:39:52,453 --> 01:39:54,154
I'm taking countermeasures!

1282
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:58,525
Themes were.

1283
01:39:59,594 --> 01:40:01,595
Dagger-1 is descending.

1284
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:05,098
- Talk, Bob!
- Turn, Phoenix! Frost!

1285
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,234
in the direction of 9! 9!

1286
01:40:07,535 --> 01:40:09,736
Rooster, there are two more ﻿behind you!

1287
01:40:09,971 --> 01:40:11,638
Dagger-2 on the defensive!

1288
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,110
Payback, put your nose down!

1289
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:19,379
Dagger-4 to 3,
use your deflectors!

1290
01:40:19,447 --> 01:40:20,947
- Talk, Bob!
- It's bad!

1291
01:40:20,982 --> 01:40:23,416
- It's coming again!
- We're busy here!

1292
01:40:30,057 --> 01:40:32,025
Dagger-2 on the defensive!

1293
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,561
Fuck, I'm out of deflectors!

1294
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:36,162
Rooster, Sallan! Sallan!

1295
01:40:36,264 --> 01:40:38,865
I can't escape!
They're after me, they're after me!

1296
01:40:49,443 --> 01:40:50,944
No! No!

1297
01:40:52,647 --> 01:40:54,114
Dagger-1 has been hit!

1298
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:56,216
I repeat, Dagger-1 has been hit!

1299
01:40:56,317 --> 01:40:57,651
Maverick crashed.

1300
01:40:57,718 --> 01:41:00,487
Dagger-1, status
report? Status report?

1301
01:41:00,588 --> 01:41:03,323
Has anyone seen him?
Has anyone seen him?

1302
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:05,292
- Dagger-1, answer!
- I didn't see a parachute.

1303
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,093
We need to go back.

1304
01:41:07,094 --> 01:41:08,728
Komanchi, the enemies are on their way.

1305
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:11,498
They come straight to you. Dagger
is suggested to move south.

1306
01:41:12,033 --> 01:41:13,833
Enemies are heading south.

1307
01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:18,772
Call them aboard now.

1308
01:41:18,873 --> 01:41:21,741
All Daggers advance to ECP
. The ship is waiting for you.

1309
01:41:21,776 --> 01:41:24,477
- What about Maverick?
- Tell him there's nothing you can do for Maverick.

1310
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:28,515
- Not in an F-18.
- Dagger-Reinforcement recovery mission requests confirmation.

1311
01:41:31,152 --> 01:41:32,786
Negative, Reinforcement.

1312
01:41:33,054 --> 01:41:35,689
- Start search and rescue.
- Negative. Not when the enemies are there.

1313
01:41:35,723 --> 01:41:38,925
- Sir, Maverick is still there...
- We're not going to lose anyone else today.

1314
01:41:41,128 --> 01:41:42,862
Call them home now.

1315
01:41:42,897 --> 01:41:45,165
Dagger, don't make contact.

1316
01:41:45,366 --> 01:41:47,601
I repeat, do not contact.

1317
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:49,202
Dagger-2, we're going home.

1318
01:41:49,303 --> 01:41:51,738
come back. Turn back.

1319
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:53,640
Rooster, those enemies are approaching.

1320
01:41:53,841 --> 01:41:55,642
We can't go back.

1321
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,444
Rooster.

1322
01:41:57,478 --> 01:41:59,212
He died.

1323
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,715
Maverick is dead.

1324
01:43:38,814 --> 01:43:40,674
Dagger-2 was shot down.

1325
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:43,950
Dagger-2 was shot down.

1326
01:43:44,919 --> 01:43:46,953
Dagger-2, come in.

1327
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:50,123
Dagger-2, do you hear?

1328
01:43:50,491 --> 01:43:52,826
Dagger-2, answer!

1329
01:44:18,285 --> 01:44:20,253
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am good.

1330
01:44:20,321 --> 01:44:21,588
are you okay?

1331
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:24,290
What are you doing?!

1332
01:44:24,325 --> 01:44:25,558
What are you doing here?

1333
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:27,894
- What am I doing?
- You shoot that missile too...

1334
01:44:27,962 --> 01:44:31,431
... did I eat it to get shot?
You should be on board right now!

1335
01:44:31,465 --> 01:44:34,601
- I saved your life!
- I saved your life.

1336
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:36,503
That was the whole point.

1337
01:44:36,537 --> 01:44:38,471
What was on your mind?

1338
01:44:38,572 --> 01:44:40,540
You're the one who said don't think!

1339
01:44:56,991 --> 01:44:58,591
Neyse...

1340
01:44:59,894 --> 01:45:01,427
It's good to see you.

1341
01:45:03,164 --> 01:45:05,298
Seni of.

1342
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:10,570
So what's the plan?

1343
01:45:21,282 --> 01:45:23,283
You cannot be serious.

1344
01:45:38,566 --> 01:45:40,667
You're goofing off, aren't you?

1345
01:45:41,602 --> 01:45:43,069
An F-14?

1346
01:45:43,137 --> 01:45:45,471
I had taken down three enemies ﻿on one of those things .

1347
01:45:45,573 --> 01:45:47,707
How do we know if ﻿that scrap can fly ?

1348
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,745
Öğrenelim hadi.

1349
01:45:54,882 --> 01:45:56,282
Tamam.

1350
01:46:04,959 --> 01:46:07,026
- There are men ahead.
- Yes.

1351
01:46:08,062 --> 01:46:10,396
- Let's not draw attention.
- OK.

1352
01:46:11,465 --> 01:46:13,600
Let's start running. Run, come on!

1353
01:46:22,843 --> 01:46:25,678
rooster When he gives you
the signal...

1354
01:46:25,913 --> 01:46:28,715
.. when the needle reaches 120
, turn the lever.

1355
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:32,518
When the engine starts, all the
pins and cables are removed.

1356
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,087
- Got it?
- Yes.

1357
01:46:36,357 --> 01:46:37,657
Evet!

1358
01:46:39,593 --> 01:46:41,694
Collect the ladder when you get up.

1359
01:46:49,436 --> 01:46:50,904
Tamam.

1360
01:46:51,272 --> 01:46:52,505
Vay be...

1361
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:54,941
It's been a long time, huh Mav?

1362
01:47:23,237 --> 01:47:25,104
oh my god...

1363
01:47:25,372 --> 01:47:26,873
This thing is very old.

1364
01:47:26,874 --> 01:47:28,574
Let's see.

1365
01:47:33,414 --> 01:47:35,381
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1366
01:47:53,334 --> 01:47:55,268
Even if the track isn't clean...

1367
01:47:55,769 --> 01:47:58,438
...how do we ventilate this museum scrap
?

1368
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:10,483
Wings from here, Mav.

1369
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,424
Mav, it's a taxiway.

1370
01:48:18,459 --> 01:48:22,628
It's not the runway. You have a very narrow take-
off area, Mav.

1371
01:48:22,863 --> 01:48:24,530
You hold on tight.

1372
01:48:25,766 --> 01:48:27,433
Hassiktir be!

1373
01:48:31,972 --> 01:48:33,639
Hadi, hadi, hadi!

1374
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:35,775
I know you, come on.

1375
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:39,245
Mav?

1376
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:41,481
Come on, some more!

1377
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:45,051
- Blue!
- Here we go.

1378
01:48:46,153 --> 01:48:47,954
Hassiktir be...

1379
01:49:01,135 --> 01:49:04,337
Sir,
we're picking up signals from Rooster's GPS.

1380
01:49:04,605 --> 01:49:05,938
It doesn't look like a malfunction.

1381
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:08,274
- Did you lose him?
- No, sir.

1382
01:49:08,642 --> 01:49:10,543
Supersonic right now.

1383
01:49:10,878 --> 01:49:12,712
Havada.

1384
01:49:13,113 --> 01:49:15,148
- What is it in?
- Sorry!

1385
01:49:15,482 --> 01:49:19,752
Information came from the tower that there was an F-14 ﻿heading towards our position .

1386
01:49:20,621 --> 01:49:22,188
This is impossible.

1387
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:23,890
They can't.

1388
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:26,626
Maverick.

1389
01:49:28,028 --> 01:49:30,930
All right, Rooster.
Contact the ship.

1390
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:31,831
Uğraşıyorum.

1391
01:49:31,965 --> 01:49:34,500
No wireless. There is no radar.

1392
01:49:34,735 --> 01:49:35,935
Everything is dead here.

1393
01:49:36,003 --> 01:49:37,703
What will I do? Tell me.

1394
01:49:37,771 --> 01:49:40,740
Radio first. do something...

1395
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:42,975
UHF-2... circuit breaker.

1396
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:44,177
Onu dene.

1397
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:47,213
Lots of weird circuits
here. Any other details?

1398
01:49:47,281 --> 01:49:49,449
I don't know. It was your father
's department.

1399
01:49:49,483 --> 01:49:51,117
I solve it.

1400
01:49:53,787 --> 01:49:56,055
Mav, enemy aircraft below us.

1401
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:02,929
what to do

1402
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:05,731
OK, listen. act calm.

1403
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:08,034
If they knew who we are , we'd
be dead already.

1404
01:50:09,470 --> 01:50:12,038
Here they come.

1405
01:50:12,339 --> 01:50:13,372
Planın ne?

1406
01:50:13,474 --> 01:50:15,441
Let's put on our masks.

1407
01:50:16,043 --> 01:50:18,711
Remember, we're on the same team.

1408
01:50:21,081 --> 01:50:23,082
Wave and smile.

1409
01:50:23,417 --> 01:50:25,985
Wave and smile.

1410
01:50:32,593 --> 01:50:34,393
What is this signal? What is he saying?

1411
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:36,929
I don't know at all. I don't know what
he says.

1412
01:50:37,564 --> 01:50:39,232
What about this? Any idea?

1413
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:41,334
No, I've never seen that either.

1414
01:50:44,438 --> 01:50:46,205
Hassiktir.

1415
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:48,908
They're trying to envelop us.

1416
01:50:49,877 --> 01:50:50,943
OK, listen.

1417
01:50:51,011 --> 01:50:53,479
When I tell you,
keep the rings on your head.

1418
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:55,648
They're the launch rope.

1419
01:50:56,049 --> 01:50:58,784
Mav, can we ﻿beat these guys

1420
01:50:59,086 --> 01:51:01,087
With loads of guns and missiles.

1421
01:51:05,759 --> 01:51:07,660
Then there will be a dogfight.

1422
01:51:08,095 --> 01:51:11,564
In an F-14? Against 5th
generation warplanes?

1423
01:51:12,432 --> 01:51:14,934
It's not on the plane, it's on the pilot.

1424
01:51:16,036 --> 01:51:18,304
If it wasn't for me, you'd be after them.

1425
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:20,740
But you are here.

1426
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:23,042
Hadi, Mav.

1427
01:51:23,944 --> 01:51:25,578
Düşünme.

1428
01:51:25,946 --> 01:51:27,914
Sadece yap.

1429
01:51:42,663 --> 01:51:44,797
If you see a launch missile, tell me!

1430
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:51,204
- The missile has taken off! The missile took off!
- Hold tight!

1431
01:51:54,374 --> 01:51:56,542
Damn it, man! Someone's gone!

1432
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:03,282
Another one is coming!

1433
01:52:06,553 --> 01:52:08,387
Rooster, deflectors!
Come on come on come on!

1434
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:13,392
Get ready to cut gas!

1435
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:17,096
Dönüyoruz!

1436
01:52:21,134 --> 01:52:23,569
- Now it's my turn.
- On target, man! On target!

1437
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:25,271
I'm shooting!

1438
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:32,812
What was that?

1439
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,548
It's silly, what was that?

1440
01:52:36,817 --> 01:52:38,985
Hold tight! We will descend.

1441
01:52:39,019 --> 01:52:41,621
Rough terrain
will confuse the targeting system.

1442
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:45,091
Here it comes.

1443
01:52:57,137 --> 01:52:59,038
Speak, Rooster. Where?

1444
01:52:59,473 --> 01:53:01,173
It's still after us.

1445
01:53:07,781 --> 01:53:09,815
The fire is getting ready to open!

1446
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:11,150
damn it!

1447
01:53:15,122 --> 01:53:17,156
Come on, man!
Be a hero!

1448
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:18,557
Hold tight!

1449
01:53:27,501 --> 01:53:29,568
Hassiktir!

1450
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:38,244
On target! I open fire.

1451
01:53:42,382 --> 01:53:43,683
damn it!

1452
01:53:45,052 --> 01:53:47,253
Missiles are gone. I'm on the gun.

1453
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,094
Hadi, Mav. Hadi!

1454
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:59,031
- You can, man!
- Once again.

1455
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:05,538
- One last chance.
- You can do it.

1456
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:08,040
Hadi, Maverick.

1457
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:19,785
Yes! We're done!

1458
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:31,630
Mav, I turned on the radio.

1459
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:34,700
- Great. Communicate with the ship.
- Understood.

1460
01:54:36,803 --> 01:54:38,571
oh my god.

1461
01:54:39,906 --> 01:54:41,907
Where is this man?

1462
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:44,710
right under our noses.

1463
01:54:47,981 --> 01:54:49,648
Damn, we're out of ammo.

1464
01:54:51,151 --> 01:54:53,652
The missile took off!
Rooster, deflectors!

1465
01:54:56,189 --> 01:54:57,957
This was so close!

1466
01:55:00,694 --> 01:55:02,628
We're out of deflectors, Mav.

1467
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:08,267
Shit, he's targeting us!

1468
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:14,874
This has not been good!

1469
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:24,950
- Mitchell, we're gonna get shot!
- No no no!

1470
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:31,590
We can't take it anymore!

1471
01:55:31,691 --> 01:55:33,726
We ca n't escape ﻿this man . We have to throw it.

1472
01:55:33,794 --> 01:55:35,060
- What?
- We need altitude.

1473
01:55:35,128 --> 01:55:37,163
Pull the launch handle ﻿as soon as I tell you .

1474
01:55:37,197 --> 01:55:39,231
- Mav, what...?
- Rooster, you're leaving.

1475
01:55:42,469 --> 01:55:44,503
Throw, throw, throw!

1476
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:47,339
Rooster, pull the lever! Throw it!

1477
01:55:47,574 --> 01:55:49,241
It doesn't work!

1478
01:55:59,186 --> 01:56:01,020
Mav!

1479
01:56:02,989 --> 01:56:04,723
Üzgünüm.

1480
01:56:05,859 --> 01:56:07,993
Sorry, kid.

1481
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,141
No need to stand up
, ladies and gentlemen.

1482
01:56:22,175 --> 01:56:24,310
Your savior is speaking.

1483
01:56:24,578 --> 01:56:28,614
Please fasten your seat belts
and follow me home.

1484
01:56:29,716 --> 01:56:31,817
And prepare to land.

1485
01:56:34,387 --> 01:56:36,856
Hey, Hangman. You look good.

1486
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:38,757
İyiyim, Rooster.

1487
01:56:38,792 --> 01:56:40,459
I am very good.

1488
01:56:41,795 --> 01:56:43,996
See you on board.

1489
01:57:05,051 --> 01:57:08,988
Maverick goes against the wind.
It has no front landing gear and no brakes.

1490
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:10,523
Pull the rope for a hard stop.

1491
01:57:10,557 --> 01:57:13,759
All personnel on deck!

1492
01:57:13,793 --> 01:57:15,594
Come on, walk!

1493
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:39,318
Please don't tell me we lost ﻿an engine .

1494
01:57:39,386 --> 01:57:41,186
OK, I won't tell you that.

1495
01:57:41,254 --> 01:57:42,454
Tamam.

1496
01:57:42,455 --> 01:57:43,022
Tamam.

1497
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:08,647
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1498
01:58:08,682 --> 01:58:10,249
İyiyim.

1499
01:58:54,628 --> 01:58:57,863
- You finally landed a plane in battle.
- That's two.

1500
01:58:58,231 --> 01:58:59,665
Maverick downloaded five.

1501
01:58:59,699 --> 01:59:01,800
That makes it second.

1502
01:59:19,386 --> 01:59:22,054
Yüzbaşı Mitchell?

1503
01:59:28,428 --> 01:59:30,162
Efendim?

1504
01:59:37,237 --> 01:59:39,405
Thank you for ﻿saving my life .

1505
01:59:40,373 --> 01:59:42,808
My father would do the same.

1506
02:00:21,281 --> 02:00:23,082
Hey, Mav.

1507
02:00:23,149 --> 02:00:24,717
Jimmy.

1508
02:00:25,018 --> 02:00:27,152
Acaba...

1509
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,254
Is Penny around?

1510
02:00:29,289 --> 02:00:32,491
They went on a boat trip ﻿with Emilia .

1511
02:00:34,928 --> 02:00:36,829
Did he say when he'll be back?

1512
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:39,198
No, he didn't.
